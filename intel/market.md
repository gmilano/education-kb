# Education AI — market map and opportunities by region

Researched 2026-11-13. Where sources disagree, the disagreement is shown rather
than averaged away. Market-size figures for AI in education come largely from
vendor blogs citing differing research firms and should be treated as
order-of-magnitude only.

## Market size — contested

Four 2026 figures for the AI-in-education market, all for the same year:
**$10.4B**, **$11.4B**, **$12.3B** (HolonIQ), and projections running from
$32.3B (by 2030) to $57B (by 2033). All trace to secondary vendor sources. Use
"roughly $10–12B in 2026, growing fast" and do not quote a specific figure to a
client without a primary report.

**Segment figures added 2026-11-13 (third pass).** The whole-market number is
the least useful one to carry into a conversation; the segment numbers are
narrower and better matched to what a studio actually sells:

| Segment | 2026 | Forecast | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Agentic AI in education** | **$2.37B** | $11.83B by 2031 | Mordor Intelligence |
| **AI tutors** | **$2.7B** | $17.7B by 2033 | Grand View Research |
| AI in education (whole) | $11.4B | 25.9% CAGR 2026–2033 | Grand View Research |

Mordor also puts **Intelligent Tutoring Systems at 26.04% of the agentic
education segment (2025)** — the largest single share, which is consistent with
ITS being where the open-source agent supply in this KB is concentrated
(`DeepTutor`, `OATutor`, `tutor-mcp`, `ai-shifu`).

**Use the agentic figure, not the headline figure.** "$2.37B in 2026 growing to
$11.83B by 2031" is defensible, segment-correct and roughly 5× growth; "$11.4B
AI in education" includes hardware, smart classrooms and proctoring that no
studio engagement touches. Same caveat as above: all of these are secondary
vendor estimates, cited as such.

## The structural fact of this market

**Adoption has outrun governance everywhere, and the gap is the commercial
opportunity.** Every region shows the same shape — very high individual use by
students and teachers, very low institutional policy coverage:

| Evidence | Figure | Source type |
|---|---|---|
| Students using AI in their studies (16 countries) | 86% | Digital Education Council survey, via secondary |
| LATAM higher-ed institutions using AI in ≥1 area (200 institutions, 19 countries) | 87% | UNESCO IESALC study |
| LATAM institutions with any formal AI framework | 26% | UNESCO IESALC study |
| LATAM universities with no specific AI budget | 55% | UNESCO IESALC study |
| LATAM institutions that evaluate their AI implementation | 9% | UNESCO IESALC study |
| Brazilian school administrators using AI | 53% | Cetic.br |
| Brazilian schools with any AI guideline | 22% | Cetic.br |
| US faculty reporting a formal institutional AI policy | ~25% | secondary roundup |

The sellable work is therefore rarely "build a tutor". It is **governance,
integration, evaluation and teacher enablement around tools the institution is
already using unofficially.**

## Global players

**Open-source / buildable layer:** HKUDS (DeepTutor, Apache-2.0, 58.7k),
Tsinghua MAIC (OpenMAIC, MIT, 43.4k), JuneYaooo (teacher-to-skills,
Apache-2.0, 475), Open edX nonprofit (Harvard/MIT lineage), Moodle HQ,
Instructure (Canvas), Learning Equality (Kolibri, MIT), Khan Academy (Perseus
MIT; Khanmigo commercially), Oppia Foundation, Frappe, OpenEduCat, and the
LTI 1.3 maintainers (Cvmcosta/ltijs Apache-2.0; Packback; Simon
Initiative/Open Learning Initiative).

**Policy and standards setters:** UNESCO and UNESCO IESALC, OECD, European
Commission (AI Act, Digital Education Action Plan), 1EdTech (LTI, Caliper,
QTI), national education ministries.

**Commercial incumbents to integrate with or displace:** Instructure, Anthology,
PowerSchool, Google for Education, Microsoft Education, Duolingo, Chegg,
Coursera, 2U/edX, plus OpenAI and Anthropic distributing directly into
education — OpenAI with named government and education-system partnerships
across EMEA.

## Opportunities by region

### North America

**Adoption/regulation:** The most legislatively active region, and the activity
is restrictive rather than enabling. Trackers count **134 AI-in-education bills
across 31 states in 2026**, with the consensus read that states favour
research, transparency and guardrails over mandated classroom adoption.
Concrete instruments: **Texas** general AI law (TRAIGA) effective 2026-01-01
with **HB 2400 barring AI from delivering direct classroom instruction**;
**New York** restricting classroom AI to grade 9+ with exceptions for
diagnostics and special education; **California AB 1159** would **bar using
student data to train AI models**; **Idaho SB 1227** requires privacy
protections for AI tools in schools and produced a statewide generative-AI
framework approved August 2026; **North Carolina SL 2026-41** (AI-literacy
standards; state model policy by 2026-12-31, local policies by 2027-06-30,
teacher training by 2028-06-30); **New Jersey A 4352 / S 2862** would add AI to
curriculum and require AI credentials at public colleges. **Four states —
Idaho, Oklahoma, Virginia and Maryland — passed 2026 laws requiring both state
guidance and mandatory district-level AI policy adoption.** Federally: the April
2025 executive order "Advancing Artificial Intelligence Education for American
Youth" sets K-12 priorities, and the **K-12 AI Literacy and Readiness Act of
2026** advanced out of the House Education and Workforce Committee. District
level is where procurement now bites: **New York City** issued preliminary
guidance in March 2026 on a **green/yellow/red traffic-light framework**, and
**Chicago's** board-approved policy **bars AI from being the sole basis for
high-stakes decisions such as discipline and special-education placement**.
California may become the de facto national regulator for AI used by minors;
OpenAI and Common Sense Media proposed a ballot initiative ("Parents & Kids
Safe AI Act").

**Source conflict to respect:** one tracker holds that **TRAIGA and HB 2400 are
the only *enacted* measures** so far, which contradicts sources treating the
North Carolina, Idaho and Maryland instruments as law. Trackers mix introduced
with enacted. Verify any specific bill against the legislature before advising.

**Players:** Instructure/Canvas is the integration target that matters; Canvas
dominates higher ed. PowerSchool in K-12 SIS. Large districts (NYC, Chicago,
Denver, Charlotte-Mecklenburg) now have their own AI policies, which means
district-level procurement with real compliance requirements. Canada's rules
are mainly workplace-focused and reach education only indirectly; **Mexico was
not covered by the sources found this pass — an unverified gap, not a finding
of absence.**

**Opportunities:**
1. **Compliance-aware tutoring that respects instruction bans.** Texas HB 2400
   forbids AI *delivering instruction*; practice, feedback and teacher support
   remain open. A tutor architected as "practice and feedback, human delivers
   instruction" is sellable in states where a general tutor is not.
2. **State-mandated AI literacy programs with deadlines.** North Carolina's
   model-policy date is **within seven weeks** of this update, with local
   policies and teacher training following. Four states now mandate district
   policy adoption. Districts need curriculum, training and a policy artifact —
   deliverable work with a statutory deadline.
3. **Decision-provenance controls for high-stakes use.** Chicago's rule
   (no AI as sole basis for discipline or placement) and NYC's traffic-light
   tiers are implementable as technical controls: human-in-the-loop gates,
   decision logging, tier-based tool allowlists. No open-source project covers
   this; it is consulting plus a small platform.
4. **Canvas-native agents.** `canvas-mcp` (MIT, 324 stars) plus `ltijs`
   (Apache-2.0) is the fastest route to an agent inside the dominant North
   American LMS.
5. **Student-data-boundary architecture.** If AB 1159 passes, "student data
   never reaches model training" becomes a contractual requirement — which
   means self-hosted or no-train-guarantee inference, and an auditable data
   path. Build it once, sell it in every state that follows.

#### Update 2026-11-13 (third pass) — regulation hardened, and a platform default changed the ground

- **The governance gap now has a number.** Google's November 2026 education
  report (Gallup-based) finds **85% of educators say they use generative AI**
  while **only 18% of US teachers report having received any formal AI guidance**
  from administrators. That 85/18 split is the single most sellable statistic in
  this KB: the demand is not for AI capability, it is for governance of AI
  already in use.
- **A platform default became policy.** Google is making **Gemini and Search
  opt-in (off by default) for K-12 student accounts**, administrator-enabled,
  with the change starting early 2027; traditional Search without AI summaries
  is **not** offered as an option (AI Mode and AI Overviews stay built in).
  Political backlash followed (Bernie Sanders, NYC Mayor Zohran Mamdani).
  **Consequence for engagements:** districts now face an explicit
  enable/disable decision with no middle setting, which converts "should we
  allow AI" from a philosophical question into a dated administrative task with
  a deadline. That is a procurement trigger.
- **Binding state law, not just guidance.** Maryland **SB 720** signed,
  effective **2026-06-01**. Oklahoma **SB 1734** signed May 2026 (age-appropriate
  tools, mandatory teacher review of AI output, parent opt-out). Ohio requires
  every public, community and STEM school to **adopt an AI framework by
  2026-07-01**. Mississippi embeds AI literacy into general education for all
  incoming undergraduates from **Fall 2026** and requires institutions to
  evaluate AI tools for bias. Florida's state board approved AI rules covering
  K-12 **and all 28 state colleges**.
- **Federal: still no binding curriculum standard.** The **K-12 AI Literacy and
  Readiness Act of 2026** was advanced by the House Education and Workforce
  Committee; status beyond committee unconfirmed. Treat federal action as a
  watch item, state action as the real driver.
- **Institution-level mandates are the new unit.** UT Austin requires every
  course syllabus from **Fall 2026** to carry a **Course AI Policy Statement**
  classifying generative AI as permitted / partially permitted / prohibited.
  This is a per-course, per-term artifact at university scale — i.e. a
  templating and compliance-tracking problem, which is a product.
- **Source conflict, recorded:** state-guidance counts range from "28+ states
  plus DC" to "34+ states plus DC/PR" across secondary trackers. Quote the
  direction, not the count.

### EMEA

**Adoption/regulation:** The binding regime is the **EU AI Act**, under which
AI for **access, allocation, assessment, or monitoring of pupils during tests**
is high-risk in principle (Annex III), with an exception for genuinely low-risk
uses. The **Digital Omnibus on AI was published in the Official Journal on
2026-07-24 as Regulation (EU) 2026/1744**, and the timeline it sets is
**2027-12-02 for stand-alone Annex III systems** and **2028-08-02 for AI
embedded in regulated products**, with transparency duties from August 2026.
**Sources conflict:** at least one consultancy states full enforcement of
high-risk requirements arrived in August 2026. Verify against EUR-Lex
(Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 as amended) before advising. The
**emotion-recognition ban in education** has applied since February 2025. The
**AI literacy duty (Article 4)** was softened in July 2026 to a duty to
"support the development of AI literacy". On 2026-06-18 the **European
Commission and OECD published an AI literacy framework for primary and
secondary schools** alongside updated ethical guidelines ("Empowering Learners
for the Age of AI"). **Council of the EU document ST-14902-2026 (2026-10-29)**
makes digital sovereignty and strategic autonomy explicit, treating reduced
dependence on AI tools developed outside Europe as critical for education and
training. Funding channels: Digital Education Action Plan, Erasmus+, Horizon
Europe, ESF+.

**Middle East:** materially more active than this KB previously recorded. The
**UAE** has expanded academic offerings to include AI-focused programs at all
levels; **Saudi Arabia has made AI literacy a mandatory component of
undergraduate education**; **Dubai's KHDA has issued explicit guidance to
private schools** on responsible AI use. Gulf AI spending is shifting from
pilots to sector-scale rollouts.

**Africa:** the **African Union's Continental Education Strategy for Africa
(CESA 16-25)** sets the digital-education direction, and structured AI use is
driven by **government and NGO programs rather than individual teacher
adoption** — which means the buyer is a ministry or a donor, not a school.
**Morocco's "AI Made in Morocco"** strategy targets the academia-industry gap.
First Africa-origin education agent found: **EDUKAI LongView** (ISC, Guinea,
bilingual FR/EN) — a 0-star prototype, but evidence of local capability.

**Players:** Moodle (dominant in European public education), ILIAS
(German-speaking vocational and public sector), Chamilo (Spain, francophone
Africa), Opencast and BigBlueButton (university infrastructure), national
ministries and agencies. **OpenAI reports government and education-system
partnerships including Estonia, Slovakia, Greece and Italy**, citing teacher
adoption and time savings — i.e. the frontier labs are already inside the
public systems a studio would sell to.

**Opportunities:**
1. **High-risk conformity packages for assessment and admissions AI.** The
   deadline moved to 2027-12-02; it did not disappear, and the conflicting
   August-2026 reading means some clients believe they are already late.
   Institutions need risk management, documentation, human oversight and
   logging for systems they already run. Highest-value regulated work in
   education globally.
2. **Sovereign, self-hosted education AI.** The Council's October 2026
   sovereignty language plus GDPR makes "runs in our own infrastructure, on
   open weights" a procurement requirement rather than a preference.
   Moodle/ILIAS + self-hosted inference + MIT/Apache agent layer, with a
   Moodle MCP server (`Faixiang`, MIT) for agent access, is a directly
   sellable stack — and it is the explicit counter-position to the OpenAI
   national partnerships.
3. **AI literacy delivery against the Commission/OECD framework.** A published
   framework, institutional obligations behind it, and a teacher population
   that needs training.
4. **Gulf mandate delivery.** Saudi Arabia's mandatory undergraduate AI
   literacy and the UAE's all-levels programs are funded, dated obligations at
   national scale — curriculum, teacher training and platform work, with a
   buyer that pays.
5. **Ministry-and-donor-scale African programs.** Since adoption is program-led
   under CESA, the deliverable is a national or donor-funded rollout:
   Kolibri (MIT, offline-first) plus localized content, with FR/EN bilingual
   handling as a baseline requirement rather than a feature.

#### Update 2026-11-13 (third pass) — the high-risk deadline moved, and that changes the sales motion

- **The Annex III high-risk deadline moved to 2027-12-02.** The **Digital
  Omnibus** postponed the standalone high-risk obligations under Annex III —
  the category containing education — from the previously circulated
  **2026-08-02** to **2 December 2027**. Earlier vendor guides still print the
  2026 date. **Verify against Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 and the Commission's own
  pages before quoting either to a client**, and expect the client's incumbent
  advisor to be working from the old date.
- **What this does to the pitch:** the compliance deadline is no longer
  imminent, so "you must be conformant by August" is dead as an urgency lever
  and repeating it will cost credibility. The live lever is the **two
  obligations already in force**: the **Article 5(1)(f) ban on emotion
  inference in education institutions** (applicable since **2025-02-02**,
  medical/safety exceptions only) and the **AI literacy duty** (same date).
  Those are enforceable now.
- **Scope is narrower than most clients assume.** Education AI is high-risk
  only when it performs one of the four functions in **Annex III point 3**:
  admissions/access, evaluating learning outcomes, assessing appropriate
  education level, or monitoring students during tests. The Commission's **May
  2026 draft guidelines** place **tutoring, practice feedback and information
  chatbots generally outside** high-risk. **This is a scoping instrument:** a
  practice tutor that never scores of record stays out; the moment it writes a
  grade of record it is in.
- **The obligation sits on the vendor, not the school.** Conformity assessment
  applies to the **EdTech vendor as provider**; schools are **deployers** (use
  as instructed, trained human oversight, logging, inform students and
  parents). A studio building for an institution may become the provider — that
  allocation must be settled in the contract, not discovered at audit.
- **EU-level frameworks to cite:** the Commission and **OECD** jointly
  published the **AILit** AI Literacy Framework ("Empowering Learners for the
  Age of AI") on **2026-06-17**; further guidance landed **2026-03-05** under
  the Digital Education Action Plan (ethical use of AI and data in teaching,
  disinformation and digital literacy, criteria for selecting high-quality
  digital education content). The **European AI Office** is the institutional
  counterpart.
- **Sovereignty angle, with a repo attached:** `openfun/ralph` (MIT) is a
  Learning Record Store from **France Université Numérique** — an EU
  public-education-origin, permissively licensed data layer. For an EU client
  asking where learner data lives, that is a concrete answer rather than a
  posture.

### APAC

**Adoption/regulation:** The most fragmented region, and education is usually
caught as a *high-risk category inside general* AI law rather than addressed
directly. **South Korea's AI Basic Act entered into force 2026-01-22** and
names education a high-impact area alongside healthcare and finance; year one
is reported as a pilot with limited enforcement and enforcement decrees still
being finalized. **Vietnam's binding AI law** puts education in its high-risk
category and requires **pre-deployment registration and human oversight**, with
an implementing decree in April 2026; **one source gives high-risk sectors
until September 2027 to comply** — the compliance deadline and the
in-force date are different things and sources blur them, so verify.
**Japan** has the **AI Promotion Act (June 2025)**, though other sources
characterise Japan as voluntary-guidelines-and-self-regulation; both can be
true (a promotion-oriented statute without high-risk obligations), but do not
assert either without checking. **Australia** has no AI-specific statute; its
2024 mandatory-guardrails proposal covers high-risk education uses, and the
higher-ed regulator **TEQSA has required universities to submit generative-AI
risk management plans**. **China** has the most detailed binding rules (content
labelling, algorithm registration) but they are not education-specific.
**Singapore and New Zealand** rely on voluntary toolkits and existing law.
The EU AI Act reaches APAC vendors selling into Europe.

**Public opinion is moving, and not uniformly:** the **Ipsos Education Monitor
2026** finds overall lower support for banning AI in schools across the Asian
markets examined, but support for a ban **rose in Japan and South Korea** while
it **fell in Indonesia**. A region-wide message will misfire; the political risk
of classroom AI is increasing in exactly the two most advanced markets.

**Players:** Tsinghua MAIC (OpenMAIC, MIT, 43.4k), HKUDS (DeepTutor,
Apache-2.0, 58.7k) and JuneYaooo (teacher-to-skills, Apache-2.0, 475) — **the
three largest education AI agent projects in the world are all APAC-origin**.
India: BHASHINI language infrastructure and DIKSHA (already shipping AI
features such as in-video keyword search and read-aloud for visually impaired
learners); **Bharat EduAI Stack** open Indic-language models announced
September 2026 by IIT Madras-incubated Bodhan AI — an announcement, not a
rollout. Moodle and Frappe LMS are widely deployed. Every major APAC economy is
building domestically owned models; regional adoption is characterised as broad
but shallow.

**Opportunities:**
1. **Multi-jurisdiction compliance architecture.** A regional university group
   or edtech vendor faces Korean high-impact rules, Vietnamese registration,
   Australian TEQSA plans, Chinese labelling and the EU Act for exports — all
   at once. One policy-enforcement layer with per-jurisdiction configuration is
   a genuine architecture problem worth paying for.
2. **Vietnam pre-deployment registration and human oversight.** A hard,
   binding obligation already in force, with a compliance runway that sources
   place as late as September 2027. First-mover advisory plus the technical
   oversight/logging layer it requires.
3. **Localize the APAC-origin agents.** DeepTutor (Apache-2.0), OpenMAIC (MIT)
   and teacher-to-skills (Apache-2.0) are permissively licensed, large and
   built in the region. Adapting them to Indic, Bahasa, Thai, Vietnamese and
   Japanese curricula is lower-risk than building a tutor from zero.
4. **Sovereign deployment for localization mandates.** Self-hosted open weights
   plus a local LMS answers data-residency requirements directly.
5. **Teacher-led framing for Japan and Korea.** With ban sentiment rising in
   both, the saleable product is explicitly teacher-augmenting and
   parent-legible — `teacher-to-skills`-shaped (distil the teacher, keep them
   in the loop) rather than student-facing autonomous tutoring.

#### Update 2026-11-13 (third pass) — four regimes, four different instruments, and a cautionary rollout

- **South Korea — the region's first comprehensive statute.** The **AI Basic
  Act has been in force since 2026-01-22**. Generative AI users must be told
  they are interacting with AI, and generated content must be marked. Korea
  **declined** to add a text-and-data-mining exception to its Copyright Act in
  February 2026 — relevant to any training-on-course-materials proposal. A PIPA
  special provision for AI development reportedly passed 2026-08-20 and is
  **not yet in force** (tracker-sourced; verify).
- **Korea is also the cautionary tale.** Korea rolled out **AI-powered digital
  textbooks from 2025**, the first country to attempt it at national scale, and
  met **parental and teacher backlash over screen time**. Any national-scale
  pitch should cite this and lead with the mitigation, because the client's
  ministry will already know it.
- **China — no general AI law, binding specific rules.** Mandatory regimes
  cover recommendation algorithms, deepfakes, generative AI services, and
  **labelling of AI-generated content since 2025-09-01**. Note also that China
  **banned the private tutoring sector**, which is why **TAL pivoted into AI
  learning hardware** — the money moved from services to devices.
- **Japan — light touch.** The **AI Promotion Act (May 2025)** encourages
  cooperation with government safety measures and carries **no monetary
  penalties**. Lowest regulatory friction in the region.
- **India — labelling in force, statute signalled.** Amended IT Rules require
  AI-generated content to carry **prominent labels and provenance markers from
  2026-02-20**; in **July 2026** the government signalled it may pursue
  dedicated AI legislation. **PhysicsWallah** launched its own AI tutor;
  **BYJU'S** collapse is still the reference failure in the market.
- **Commercial players to know:** **Mathpresso's QANDA** (Korea, math-solving,
  global reach), **ByteDance's Gauth** (a top education app **in the US** —
  APAC-built product winning a North American market), TAL, PhysicsWallah.
- **Declared gap:** no source found in this pass regulates **AI in the
  classroom** specifically in any of these four countries — the instruments are
  economy-wide AI law plus content labelling. Education-specific rules must be
  verified **directly with each country's education ministry**; do not infer
  them from the AI statutes.

### LATAM

**Adoption/regulation:** The widest gap between use and governance of any
region, and the best-documented. **UNESCO IESALC, across 200 institutions in 19
countries: 87% of higher-education institutions use AI in at least one area,
26% have any formal framework, 55% of universities have no specific AI budget,
and only 9% evaluate their AI implementation.** In schools, **more than 50% of
teachers in countries such as Chile and Brazil already use AI tools, while
fewer than 10% of institutions have formal guidelines.** Brazil's **Cetic.br**
reports **53% of school administrators using AI against 22% of schools having
any guideline**. The Digital Education Council's **2026 LATAM higher-ed survey
(with Tecnológico de Monterrey's Institute for the Future of Education) reports
92% of students and 79% of faculty actively engaging with AI.** Regulation is
fragmented: a 2026 **Universidad de los Andes** inventory identified **716
AI-related regulatory instruments, rules and proposals across 23 countries and
territories**. **Brazil's PL 2.338/2023** is the main risk-based bill;
**Colombia** adopted a national AI policy via **CONPES 4144 (February 2025)**
with budgeted actions through 2030 rather than immediate horizontal
obligations. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico and Peru
have adopted the OECD AI Principles.

**Players:** UNESCO IESALC — launched an **Observatory on AI in Education for
Latin America and the Caribbean in April 2026** to guide public policy;
**Cetic.br** (Brazil) and **Ceibal** (Uruguay) as national data sources and, in
Ceibal's case, a national deployment vehicle; Tecnológico de Monterrey; World
Economic Forum (regional white paper arguing for harmonized regulation);
Universidad de los Andes. Platform-wise: Moodle, Chamilo and RosarioSIS have
deep regional footprints. **New: the first LATAM-origin education agents** —
Manu (`Jeanikt/tutor-ai-agent`, MIT, Brazilian Portuguese voice math tutor) and
`nifalconi/educational-agents` (Chile, from the Niñas Pro girls' AI course,
**unlicensed as published**). Both are 0–1 star prototypes.

**Opportunities:**
1. **Institutional AI governance as a productized offering.** 87% using, 26%
   governed, 9% evaluating; 53% of Brazilian administrators using against 22%
   with guidelines. This is the single clearest product-market fit in this
   entire KB: a repeatable package of policy, controls, teacher training and an
   evaluation harness.
2. **Evaluation and measurement.** Only 9% evaluate. An evaluation layer
   (pedagogical eval plus xAPI/Caliper telemetry plus dashboards) is a
   defensible, repeatable deliverable — and `AITutor-EvalKit` (MIT) plus pyKT
   (MIT) give it an open-source spine, thin as they are.
3. **Low-budget deployment models.** 55% have no AI budget, so the offer must be
   cheap to run: Kolibri (MIT, offline-first) or Moodle plus self-hosted open
   weights, not per-seat frontier API spend.
4. **Ceibal-style national programs.** Uruguay's Ceibal is a working template
   for country-scale deployment; similar ministry programs are the large
   contracts in this region.
5. **Spanish/Portuguese pedagogical content generation — with a shortcut.**
   `educhain` (MIT) and Oppia (Apache-2.0) localized to national curricula
   (ENEM, ICFES, PAES, SEP), and note that **OpenMAIC already ships pt-BR and
   es-MX locales**, so the largest multi-agent classroom in the world is
   already partly localized for this region.
6. **Adopt and license the local prototypes.** Manu (MIT, Brazil) is usable as
   published; the Chilean Niñas Pro library is not, for want of a LICENSE file.
   Contributing licensing and engineering to regional projects buys both
   capability and standing.

#### Update 2026-11-13 (third pass) — adoption is high, governance is near-absent, and that is the whole opportunity

- **Teachers are already using it.** TALIS (2024) secondary-teacher AI use in
  the previous year: **Brazil 56%, Chile 55%, Colombia 53%, Costa Rica 52%** —
  materially level with developed-market rates.
- **Governance is not there.** Brazilian school administrators: **53% use AI,
  22% report their school has guidelines on its use**. Higher education
  (UNESCO IESALC): **87% of regional universities already use AI, 26% have a
  formal strategy**. A 61-point gap at university level.
- **Why that specific gap is the product:** the deficit is **policy,
  procurement rules and teacher guidance** — not models and not infrastructure.
  That is a 6–8 week productizable engagement (pattern `P4`), repeatable across
  institutions in one country, and it does not compete with the hyperscalers.
- **Regulatory status, corrected against the newest source.** **Peru is the
  only country in the region with an enacted AI statute.** Brazil's framework
  (EU-influenced, stringent) is **still a pending bill**; Chile's is pending;
  **Mexico has proposals and none enacted as of early 2026**, with a stated
  emphasis on **"technological sovereignty"** and reducing reliance on foreign
  AI models. **Source conflict recorded:** one aggregator describes Brazil as
  having comprehensive legislation and another describes Chile as having moved
  to a binding rights-protective framework; the newer CASRAI comparison
  (updated September 2026) says both are pending. **Go with pending**, and
  verify before any regulatory claim in a proposal.
- **Mexico's sovereignty framing is a selling position, not an obstacle:**
  self-hosted inference on `yetanalytics/lrsql` (Apache-2.0) or `openfun/ralph`
  (MIT) with no learner data leaving the country is a direct answer to it.
- **School-level AI education is largely absent.** Chile's **CENIA** found that
  **13 of the 19** Latin American and Caribbean countries it studied **do not
  teach early AI adoption in schools**. Commentary notes systems are
  integrating AI tools into classrooms *without oversight or guidelines* —
  which is the same finding as the Brazil 53/22 split, from the other direction.
- **Declared gap:** no 2026 source found covering **edtech vendor or
  procurement rules** specifically in Brazil, Mexico or Chile. Procurement is
  where a studio engagement is actually won or lost, so this needs a dedicated
  search before any LATAM public-sector pursuit.

### Global / cross-region

**Opportunities not tied to one region:**
1. **Grading and feedback agents — the one genuinely open field.** No dominant
   open-source grading agent exists anywhere. `nbgrader` (BSD-3-Clause) is the
   substrate and `wwrwbs/AI_AWE` (Apache-2.0, 2 stars) proves the pipeline
   shape (discourse classifier → feature scorer → label-aware feedback), but
   nothing is production-grade. This is now the clearest build opportunity in
   this KB.
2. **An MCP server for the student record.** Seven Moodle MCP servers exist and
   **not one SIS has an agent interface** — not OpenEduCat, RosarioSIS, Gibbon
   or openSIS. Advising, retention and early-warning agents all need the
   student record. The LMS got the attention; the SIS got none.
3. **Pedagogical evaluation as a practice.** `AITutor-EvalKit` at 4 stars is the
   state of the art. Institutions in every region are deploying tutors with no
   way to measure teaching quality. Whoever makes this credible sets the
   standard.
4. **Consolidate or harden a Moodle MCP server.** Seven fragmented servers,
   three MIT, none proven. Moodle is the most-deployed LMS in the world and the
   incumbent across EMEA, LATAM and APAC public education. One hardened MIT
   server is reusable in most education engagements Globant will see.
5. **Teacher enablement.** Universal across regions, consistently
   under-resourced, and the one intervention every policy framework mandates —
   now with APAC public opinion (Ipsos 2026) making the teacher-augmenting
   framing commercially safer than student-facing autonomy.
