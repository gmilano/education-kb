# Education AI — market map and opportunities by region

Researched 2026-11-13. Where sources disagree, the disagreement is shown rather
than averaged away. Market-size figures for AI in education come largely from
vendor blogs citing differing research firms and should be treated as
order-of-magnitude only.

## Market size — contested

Four 2026 figures for the AI-in-education market, all for the same year:
**$10.4B**, **$11.4B**, **$12.3B** (HolonIQ), and projections running from
$32.3B (by 2030) to $57B (by 2033). All trace to secondary vendor sources. Use
"roughly $10–12B in 2026, growing fast" and do not quote a specific figure to a
client without a primary report.

## The structural fact of this market

**Adoption has outrun governance everywhere, and the gap is the commercial
opportunity.** Every region shows the same shape — very high individual use by
students and teachers, very low institutional policy coverage:

| Evidence | Figure | Source type |
|---|---|---|
| Students using AI in their studies (16 countries) | 86% | Digital Education Council survey, via secondary |
| LATAM higher-ed institutions using AI in ≥1 area (200 institutions, 19 countries) | 87% | UNESCO IESALC study |
| LATAM institutions with any formal AI framework | 26% | UNESCO IESALC study |
| LATAM universities with no specific AI budget | 55% | UNESCO IESALC study |
| LATAM institutions that evaluate their AI implementation | 9% | UNESCO IESALC study |
| Brazilian school administrators using AI | 53% | Cetic.br |
| Brazilian schools with any AI guideline | 22% | Cetic.br |
| US faculty reporting a formal institutional AI policy | ~25% | secondary roundup |

The sellable work is therefore rarely "build a tutor". It is **governance,
integration, evaluation and teacher enablement around tools the institution is
already using unofficially.**

## Global players

**Open-source / buildable layer:** HKUDS (DeepTutor, Apache-2.0, 58.7k),
Tsinghua MAIC (OpenMAIC, MIT, 43.4k), JuneYaooo (teacher-to-skills,
Apache-2.0, 475), Open edX nonprofit (Harvard/MIT lineage), Moodle HQ,
Instructure (Canvas), Learning Equality (Kolibri, MIT), Khan Academy (Perseus
MIT; Khanmigo commercially), Oppia Foundation, Frappe, OpenEduCat, and the
LTI 1.3 maintainers (Cvmcosta/ltijs Apache-2.0; Packback; Simon
Initiative/Open Learning Initiative).

**Policy and standards setters:** UNESCO and UNESCO IESALC, OECD, European
Commission (AI Act, Digital Education Action Plan), 1EdTech (LTI, Caliper,
QTI), national education ministries.

**Commercial incumbents to integrate with or displace:** Instructure, Anthology,
PowerSchool, Google for Education, Microsoft Education, Duolingo, Chegg,
Coursera, 2U/edX, plus OpenAI and Anthropic distributing directly into
education — OpenAI with named government and education-system partnerships
across EMEA.

## Opportunities by region

### North America

**Adoption/regulation:** The most legislatively active region, and the activity
is restrictive rather than enabling. Trackers count **134 AI-in-education bills
across 31 states in 2026**, with the consensus read that states favour
research, transparency and guardrails over mandated classroom adoption.
Concrete instruments: **Texas** general AI law (TRAIGA) effective 2026-01-01
with **HB 2400 barring AI from delivering direct classroom instruction**;
**New York** restricting classroom AI to grade 9+ with exceptions for
diagnostics and special education; **California AB 1159** would **bar using
student data to train AI models**; **Idaho SB 1227** requires privacy
protections for AI tools in schools and produced a statewide generative-AI
framework approved August 2026; **North Carolina SL 2026-41** (AI-literacy
standards; state model policy by 2026-12-31, local policies by 2027-06-30,
teacher training by 2028-06-30); **New Jersey A 4352 / S 2862** would add AI to
curriculum and require AI credentials at public colleges. **Four states —
Idaho, Oklahoma, Virginia and Maryland — passed 2026 laws requiring both state
guidance and mandatory district-level AI policy adoption.** Federally: the April
2025 executive order "Advancing Artificial Intelligence Education for American
Youth" sets K-12 priorities, and the **K-12 AI Literacy and Readiness Act of
2026** advanced out of the House Education and Workforce Committee. District
level is where procurement now bites: **New York City** issued preliminary
guidance in March 2026 on a **green/yellow/red traffic-light framework**, and
**Chicago's** board-approved policy **bars AI from being the sole basis for
high-stakes decisions such as discipline and special-education placement**.
California may become the de facto national regulator for AI used by minors;
OpenAI and Common Sense Media proposed a ballot initiative ("Parents & Kids
Safe AI Act").

**Source conflict to respect:** one tracker holds that **TRAIGA and HB 2400 are
the only *enacted* measures** so far, which contradicts sources treating the
North Carolina, Idaho and Maryland instruments as law. Trackers mix introduced
with enacted. Verify any specific bill against the legislature before advising.

**Players:** Instructure/Canvas is the integration target that matters; Canvas
dominates higher ed. PowerSchool in K-12 SIS. Large districts (NYC, Chicago,
Denver, Charlotte-Mecklenburg) now have their own AI policies, which means
district-level procurement with real compliance requirements. Canada's rules
are mainly workplace-focused and reach education only indirectly; **Mexico was
not covered by the sources found this pass — an unverified gap, not a finding
of absence.**

**Opportunities:**
1. **Compliance-aware tutoring that respects instruction bans.** Texas HB 2400
   forbids AI *delivering instruction*; practice, feedback and teacher support
   remain open. A tutor architected as "practice and feedback, human delivers
   instruction" is sellable in states where a general tutor is not.
2. **State-mandated AI literacy programs with deadlines.** North Carolina's
   model-policy date is **within seven weeks** of this update, with local
   policies and teacher training following. Four states now mandate district
   policy adoption. Districts need curriculum, training and a policy artifact —
   deliverable work with a statutory deadline.
3. **Decision-provenance controls for high-stakes use.** Chicago's rule
   (no AI as sole basis for discipline or placement) and NYC's traffic-light
   tiers are implementable as technical controls: human-in-the-loop gates,
   decision logging, tier-based tool allowlists. No open-source project covers
   this; it is consulting plus a small platform.
4. **Canvas-native agents.** `canvas-mcp` (MIT, 324 stars) plus `ltijs`
   (Apache-2.0) is the fastest route to an agent inside the dominant North
   American LMS.
5. **Student-data-boundary architecture.** If AB 1159 passes, "student data
   never reaches model training" becomes a contractual requirement — which
   means self-hosted or no-train-guarantee inference, and an auditable data
   path. Build it once, sell it in every state that follows.

### EMEA

**Adoption/regulation:** The binding regime is the **EU AI Act**, under which
AI for **access, allocation, assessment, or monitoring of pupils during tests**
is high-risk in principle (Annex III), with an exception for genuinely low-risk
uses. The **Digital Omnibus on AI was published in the Official Journal on
2026-07-24 as Regulation (EU) 2026/1744**, and the timeline it sets is
**2027-12-02 for stand-alone Annex III systems** and **2028-08-02 for AI
embedded in regulated products**, with transparency duties from August 2026.
**Sources conflict:** at least one consultancy states full enforcement of
high-risk requirements arrived in August 2026. Verify against EUR-Lex
(Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 as amended) before advising. The
**emotion-recognition ban in education** has applied since February 2025. The
**AI literacy duty (Article 4)** was softened in July 2026 to a duty to
"support the development of AI literacy". On 2026-06-18 the **European
Commission and OECD published an AI literacy framework for primary and
secondary schools** alongside updated ethical guidelines ("Empowering Learners
for the Age of AI"). **Council of the EU document ST-14902-2026 (2026-10-29)**
makes digital sovereignty and strategic autonomy explicit, treating reduced
dependence on AI tools developed outside Europe as critical for education and
training. Funding channels: Digital Education Action Plan, Erasmus+, Horizon
Europe, ESF+.

**Middle East:** materially more active than this KB previously recorded. The
**UAE** has expanded academic offerings to include AI-focused programs at all
levels; **Saudi Arabia has made AI literacy a mandatory component of
undergraduate education**; **Dubai's KHDA has issued explicit guidance to
private schools** on responsible AI use. Gulf AI spending is shifting from
pilots to sector-scale rollouts.

**Africa:** the **African Union's Continental Education Strategy for Africa
(CESA 16-25)** sets the digital-education direction, and structured AI use is
driven by **government and NGO programs rather than individual teacher
adoption** — which means the buyer is a ministry or a donor, not a school.
**Morocco's "AI Made in Morocco"** strategy targets the academia-industry gap.
First Africa-origin education agent found: **EDUKAI LongView** (ISC, Guinea,
bilingual FR/EN) — a 0-star prototype, but evidence of local capability.

**Players:** Moodle (dominant in European public education), ILIAS
(German-speaking vocational and public sector), Chamilo (Spain, francophone
Africa), Opencast and BigBlueButton (university infrastructure), national
ministries and agencies. **OpenAI reports government and education-system
partnerships including Estonia, Slovakia, Greece and Italy**, citing teacher
adoption and time savings — i.e. the frontier labs are already inside the
public systems a studio would sell to.

**Opportunities:**
1. **High-risk conformity packages for assessment and admissions AI.** The
   deadline moved to 2027-12-02; it did not disappear, and the conflicting
   August-2026 reading means some clients believe they are already late.
   Institutions need risk management, documentation, human oversight and
   logging for systems they already run. Highest-value regulated work in
   education globally.
2. **Sovereign, self-hosted education AI.** The Council's October 2026
   sovereignty language plus GDPR makes "runs in our own infrastructure, on
   open weights" a procurement requirement rather than a preference.
   Moodle/ILIAS + self-hosted inference + MIT/Apache agent layer, with a
   Moodle MCP server (`Faixiang`, MIT) for agent access, is a directly
   sellable stack — and it is the explicit counter-position to the OpenAI
   national partnerships.
3. **AI literacy delivery against the Commission/OECD framework.** A published
   framework, institutional obligations behind it, and a teacher population
   that needs training.
4. **Gulf mandate delivery.** Saudi Arabia's mandatory undergraduate AI
   literacy and the UAE's all-levels programs are funded, dated obligations at
   national scale — curriculum, teacher training and platform work, with a
   buyer that pays.
5. **Ministry-and-donor-scale African programs.** Since adoption is program-led
   under CESA, the deliverable is a national or donor-funded rollout:
   Kolibri (MIT, offline-first) plus localized content, with FR/EN bilingual
   handling as a baseline requirement rather than a feature.

### APAC

**Adoption/regulation:** The most fragmented region, and education is usually
caught as a *high-risk category inside general* AI law rather than addressed
directly. **South Korea's AI Basic Act entered into force 2026-01-22** and
names education a high-impact area alongside healthcare and finance; year one
is reported as a pilot with limited enforcement and enforcement decrees still
being finalized. **Vietnam's binding AI law** puts education in its high-risk
category and requires **pre-deployment registration and human oversight**, with
an implementing decree in April 2026; **one source gives high-risk sectors
until September 2027 to comply** — the compliance deadline and the
in-force date are different things and sources blur them, so verify.
**Japan** has the **AI Promotion Act (June 2025)**, though other sources
characterise Japan as voluntary-guidelines-and-self-regulation; both can be
true (a promotion-oriented statute without high-risk obligations), but do not
assert either without checking. **Australia** has no AI-specific statute; its
2024 mandatory-guardrails proposal covers high-risk education uses, and the
higher-ed regulator **TEQSA has required universities to submit generative-AI
risk management plans**. **China** has the most detailed binding rules (content
labelling, algorithm registration) but they are not education-specific.
**Singapore and New Zealand** rely on voluntary toolkits and existing law.
The EU AI Act reaches APAC vendors selling into Europe.

**Public opinion is moving, and not uniformly:** the **Ipsos Education Monitor
2026** finds overall lower support for banning AI in schools across the Asian
markets examined, but support for a ban **rose in Japan and South Korea** while
it **fell in Indonesia**. A region-wide message will misfire; the political risk
of classroom AI is increasing in exactly the two most advanced markets.

**Players:** Tsinghua MAIC (OpenMAIC, MIT, 43.4k), HKUDS (DeepTutor,
Apache-2.0, 58.7k) and JuneYaooo (teacher-to-skills, Apache-2.0, 475) — **the
three largest education AI agent projects in the world are all APAC-origin**.
India: BHASHINI language infrastructure and DIKSHA (already shipping AI
features such as in-video keyword search and read-aloud for visually impaired
learners); **Bharat EduAI Stack** open Indic-language models announced
September 2026 by IIT Madras-incubated Bodhan AI — an announcement, not a
rollout. Moodle and Frappe LMS are widely deployed. Every major APAC economy is
building domestically owned models; regional adoption is characterised as broad
but shallow.

**Opportunities:**
1. **Multi-jurisdiction compliance architecture.** A regional university group
   or edtech vendor faces Korean high-impact rules, Vietnamese registration,
   Australian TEQSA plans, Chinese labelling and the EU Act for exports — all
   at once. One policy-enforcement layer with per-jurisdiction configuration is
   a genuine architecture problem worth paying for.
2. **Vietnam pre-deployment registration and human oversight.** A hard,
   binding obligation already in force, with a compliance runway that sources
   place as late as September 2027. First-mover advisory plus the technical
   oversight/logging layer it requires.
3. **Localize the APAC-origin agents.** DeepTutor (Apache-2.0), OpenMAIC (MIT)
   and teacher-to-skills (Apache-2.0) are permissively licensed, large and
   built in the region. Adapting them to Indic, Bahasa, Thai, Vietnamese and
   Japanese curricula is lower-risk than building a tutor from zero.
4. **Sovereign deployment for localization mandates.** Self-hosted open weights
   plus a local LMS answers data-residency requirements directly.
5. **Teacher-led framing for Japan and Korea.** With ban sentiment rising in
   both, the saleable product is explicitly teacher-augmenting and
   parent-legible — `teacher-to-skills`-shaped (distil the teacher, keep them
   in the loop) rather than student-facing autonomous tutoring.

### LATAM

**Adoption/regulation:** The widest gap between use and governance of any
region, and the best-documented. **UNESCO IESALC, across 200 institutions in 19
countries: 87% of higher-education institutions use AI in at least one area,
26% have any formal framework, 55% of universities have no specific AI budget,
and only 9% evaluate their AI implementation.** In schools, **more than 50% of
teachers in countries such as Chile and Brazil already use AI tools, while
fewer than 10% of institutions have formal guidelines.** Brazil's **Cetic.br**
reports **53% of school administrators using AI against 22% of schools having
any guideline**. The Digital Education Council's **2026 LATAM higher-ed survey
(with Tecnológico de Monterrey's Institute for the Future of Education) reports
92% of students and 79% of faculty actively engaging with AI.** Regulation is
fragmented: a 2026 **Universidad de los Andes** inventory identified **716
AI-related regulatory instruments, rules and proposals across 23 countries and
territories**. **Brazil's PL 2.338/2023** is the main risk-based bill;
**Colombia** adopted a national AI policy via **CONPES 4144 (February 2025)**
with budgeted actions through 2030 rather than immediate horizontal
obligations. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico and Peru
have adopted the OECD AI Principles.

**Players:** UNESCO IESALC — launched an **Observatory on AI in Education for
Latin America and the Caribbean in April 2026** to guide public policy;
**Cetic.br** (Brazil) and **Ceibal** (Uruguay) as national data sources and, in
Ceibal's case, a national deployment vehicle; Tecnológico de Monterrey; World
Economic Forum (regional white paper arguing for harmonized regulation);
Universidad de los Andes. Platform-wise: Moodle, Chamilo and RosarioSIS have
deep regional footprints. **New: the first LATAM-origin education agents** —
Manu (`Jeanikt/tutor-ai-agent`, MIT, Brazilian Portuguese voice math tutor) and
`nifalconi/educational-agents` (Chile, from the Niñas Pro girls' AI course,
**unlicensed as published**). Both are 0–1 star prototypes.

**Opportunities:**
1. **Institutional AI governance as a productized offering.** 87% using, 26%
   governed, 9% evaluating; 53% of Brazilian administrators using against 22%
   with guidelines. This is the single clearest product-market fit in this
   entire KB: a repeatable package of policy, controls, teacher training and an
   evaluation harness.
2. **Evaluation and measurement.** Only 9% evaluate. An evaluation layer
   (pedagogical eval plus xAPI/Caliper telemetry plus dashboards) is a
   defensible, repeatable deliverable — and `AITutor-EvalKit` (MIT) plus pyKT
   (MIT) give it an open-source spine, thin as they are.
3. **Low-budget deployment models.** 55% have no AI budget, so the offer must be
   cheap to run: Kolibri (MIT, offline-first) or Moodle plus self-hosted open
   weights, not per-seat frontier API spend.
4. **Ceibal-style national programs.** Uruguay's Ceibal is a working template
   for country-scale deployment; similar ministry programs are the large
   contracts in this region.
5. **Spanish/Portuguese pedagogical content generation — with a shortcut.**
   `educhain` (MIT) and Oppia (Apache-2.0) localized to national curricula
   (ENEM, ICFES, PAES, SEP), and note that **OpenMAIC already ships pt-BR and
   es-MX locales**, so the largest multi-agent classroom in the world is
   already partly localized for this region.
6. **Adopt and license the local prototypes.** Manu (MIT, Brazil) is usable as
   published; the Chilean Niñas Pro library is not, for want of a LICENSE file.
   Contributing licensing and engineering to regional projects buys both
   capability and standing.

### Global / cross-region

**Opportunities not tied to one region:**
1. **Grading and feedback agents — the one genuinely open field.** No dominant
   open-source grading agent exists anywhere. `nbgrader` (BSD-3-Clause) is the
   substrate and `wwrwbs/AI_AWE` (Apache-2.0, 2 stars) proves the pipeline
   shape (discourse classifier → feature scorer → label-aware feedback), but
   nothing is production-grade. This is now the clearest build opportunity in
   this KB.
2. **An MCP server for the student record.** Seven Moodle MCP servers exist and
   **not one SIS has an agent interface** — not OpenEduCat, RosarioSIS, Gibbon
   or openSIS. Advising, retention and early-warning agents all need the
   student record. The LMS got the attention; the SIS got none.
3. **Pedagogical evaluation as a practice.** `AITutor-EvalKit` at 4 stars is the
   state of the art. Institutions in every region are deploying tutors with no
   way to measure teaching quality. Whoever makes this credible sets the
   standard.
4. **Consolidate or harden a Moodle MCP server.** Seven fragmented servers,
   three MIT, none proven. Moodle is the most-deployed LMS in the world and the
   incumbent across EMEA, LATAM and APAC public education. One hardened MIT
   server is reusable in most education engagements Globant will see.
5. **Teacher enablement.** Universal across regions, consistently
   under-resourced, and the one intervention every policy framework mandates —
   now with APAC public opinion (Ipsos 2026) making the teacher-augmenting
   framing commercially safer than student-facing autonomy.
