# Education industry trends

**Pass `p383` · 2026-10-22 · FULL REWRITE.** Prior version archived at

## Trend 1 — Adoption is finished. Governance is the market.

**88–95% of students and faculty already use AI; 26–54% can name a governing policy.**
That gap, not the adoption curve, is what 2026–27 budget buys.

- Coursera (n=4,200, 5 countries): **95%** using AI academically, **26%** of educators report a
  formal institutional policy.
- EDUCAUSE 2026: only **54%** are aware of *any* policy or guideline.
- Ellucian (n=779): institutional adoption **49% → 66%** year on year, with **data privacy the top
  barrier**.
- Digital Education Council (n=45,398, 35 countries): **88%** of students, **77%** of faculty.

**So:** stop selling introduction. Sell policy-to-configuration, audit trails and a governed
gateway. The shadow-AI estate already exists on every campus.

## Trend 2 — The ROI reckoning arrived, and procurement is being rewired around evidence

- **~80%** of institutions are investing in AI; **29%** of CTOs say it met or exceeded ROI
  expectations (Inside Higher Ed / Hanover).
- **~7 in 10 provosts** use AI weekly themselves; **1 in 10** report a centralised institutional
  strategy. Personal adoption has outrun institutional capability.
- The **US Department of Education's "Dear Colleague" letter** tells states to evaluate ed-tech by
  **measurable learning outcomes rather than screen time**, and to put **evidence requirements into
  procurement**.
- **US/Canada faculty intent to keep using AI fell 76% → 67%** in one year.

**So:** a before/after measurement on the client's own subject mix is becoming a procurement
precondition, not a nice-to-have. [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness),
MMLU and GSM8K are all MIT; there is no licence reason not to ship this with every engagement.

## Trend 3 — Regulatory divergence hardened in 2026. One global configuration is no longer viable.

Four regimes moved in four different directions in a single year:

| region | 2026 direction |
|---|---|
| **EU** | **Regulation (EU) 2026/1744** (OJ 24 Jul 2026) pushed high-risk education systems from 2 Aug 2026 to **2 Dec 2027** — while **Art. 50 transparency still starts 2 Aug 2026** and **Art. 4 AI literacy has bound every school since 2 Feb 2025**. Emotion recognition in education: prohibited. |
| **US** | No federal rule; **134+ bills across 31 states**, **33–35 states** with guidance, and binding district-policy mandates (Idaho SB 1227 effective 1 Jul 2026; Oklahoma SB 1734 by 2027-28). |
| **India / China** | **Content labelling and provenance**: India's amended IT Rules from **20 Feb 2026**; China's labelling measures from **1 Sep 2025** (988 services filed by 30 Jun 2026). |
| **Vietnam / Brazil / Mexico** | **Sectoral high-risk designation**: Vietnam names education among six high-risk sectors; Brazil's PL 2.338/2023 reportedly covers student selection; Mexico replicates the EU risk model. |

**So:** regional configuration is now a product requirement. The same tutor needs provenance
watermarking for India, a transparency notice for the EU, a prohibited-uses lockout for DC, and a
teacher-facing-only mode for ANZ and Brazil.

## Trend 4 — Restriction is a real countertrend, not noise

For two years the only direction was adoption. In 2026 the brake appeared:

- **District of Columbia** 2026-27 policy bans AI from **grading, discipline, IEP decisions and
  teacher evaluations** — four of the highest-value automation targets.
- **Ipsos Education Monitor 2026:** **Australia and New Zealand show the highest support for
  banning AI in schools**, while Asian markets show the lowest. One company, two opposite mandates.
- **European Schools:** **no** generative AI tool approved for system-wide use.
- 🔴 **UNCONFIRMED:** a reported **New York City moratorium** on student-facing generative AI
  (EdWeek; date metadata inconsistent). If it holds, the largest US district has gone the other way.

**So:** "student-facing optional" should be an architectural switch from day one, not a retrofit.
A product that cannot run teacher-facing-only is unsellable in a growing share of the market.

## Trend 5 — Teacher-facing is beating student-facing where growth is fastest

HolonIQ's **2026 LATAM EdTech 100** finds regional AI positioning concentrated in **teacher-facing
instructional tools rather than consumer tutoring** — Teachy (Brazil) in lesson preparation, Ginia
(Mexico) in employability. The regulation points the same way: Brazil's draft law targets
**student selection**, DC bans AI in grading and discipline, ANZ sentiment is restrictive.

**So:** the market and the regulator agree for once. Lesson preparation, assessment drafting,
feedback generation and administrative load carry the growth and avoid the hot zone.

## Trend 6 — The permissive-licence frontier runs *across* the stack, not along it

Measured first-hand this pass over 58 live repositories:

- **Platform tier is copyleft**: Moodle GPL-3.0, Open edX AGPL-3.0, Canvas AGPL-3.0, Chamilo
  GPL-3.0, ILIAS GPL-3.0, Tutor AGPL-3.0, Frappe LMS AGPL-3.0, Sakai ECL-2.0, Opencast ECL-2.0,
  OpenEduCat LGPL-3.0, H5P GPL-3.0.
- **Exactly one permissive major LMS**: **[OpenOLAT](https://github.com/OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT),
  Apache-2.0** — and no roundup we read mentions it.
- **Agent tier is permissive almost throughout**: MIT / Apache-2.0 / BSD-3.

**So:** the architecture follows from the licences. Compose permissive agents **over** a copyleft
platform across **LTI 1.3**, **MCP** or web services — never fork the platform. The interop boundary
is a legal artefact as much as a technical one.

## Trend 7 — MCP reached the LMS, and that is genuinely new

As of 2026 the LMS is addressable by agents without a fork:

- **Moodle's own plugin directory** carries **`webservice_mcp`**, exposing Moodle's external
  functions as **MCP tools over JSON-RPC 2.0** — **Moodle 4.5–5.2**, latest release
  **23 Jul 2026**, gated on the `webservice/mcp:use` capability.
- **Canvas** is served by community MIT servers ([r-huijts/canvas-mcp](https://github.com/r-huijts/canvas-mcp),
  fork [mdweaver/canvas-mcp](https://github.com/mdweaver/canvas-mcp)).
- 🔴 **No official server from Instructure or Moodle HQ**, and two of the most-advertised community
  Canvas/Moodle servers are **unlicensed** — see [`agents/top.md`](../agents/top.md).
- **12 distinct education MCP server slugs are shelved** and verified first-hand this pass, and
  across both agent shelves **MCP reaches **6 distinct LMS platforms**** — Canvas, Moodle, Google
  Classroom, Blackboard, Brightspace/D2L and Open edX. The cumulative harvest behind that is
  lopsided: **35 Canvas servers and 20 Moodle**, against **2 for Open edX**; **Blackboard has 9
  with not one verified grant and D2L has 6 with the only one checked ungranted.** The work on
  Canvas and Moodle is *selection*; on Blackboard and D2L a permissively-licensed server would be
  a real contribution.

**So:** the integration cost of an LMS-aware agent dropped by an order of magnitude this year, and
the remaining risk moved from engineering to licensing.

## Trend 8 — Measurement gap in this pass, stated rather than papered over

**No popularity metric is published this pass.** Every star channel was closed in this sandbox:
`api.github.com` 403, `github.com` HTML 403, `img.shields.io` blocked, `api.star-history.com`
blocked. The technology cycle (`v76`) had to publish a correction that earlier cycles' star counts
were **pipeline-inflated across several industries**; carrying unverifiable numbers forward would
repeat that error. Licence, default ref and liveness **were** verified first-hand for all 58 live
addresses — see [`verified-repos`](../evidence/verified-repos.2026-10-22-p383.tsv).

**So:** rank by licence permissiveness, maintenance signal and fit. Popularity was never the
decision criterion for a studio engagement anyway.
