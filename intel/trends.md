## 🆕 `p386` — The LMS-integration gap is not a licence gap any more. It is a **tenancy** gap.

For four passes this base recorded Blackboard and D2L as the two platforms where
*"a permissively-licensed MCP server would be a genuine contribution."* `p386` probed all fifteen
addresses first-hand: **6 MIT grants on Blackboard, 6 on D2L, 1 ungranted, 2 dead.** The licences
were there the whole time; nobody had read them.

🔵 **What replaced the gap is a sharper and more useful trend.** Eleven of the twelve granted
servers authenticate **as the signed-in student** — the learner's own browser SSO/MFA session or
session cookies, no admin API key, read-only because nothing else is possible from that position.
They are built by students, for themselves, at their own university, and several hard-code it.

That makes the 2026 community LMS-MCP supply a **personal-tooling** supply, and it does not become
an institutional one by being licensed well:

| what an institution needs | what a session-scraping server has |
|---|---|
| tenant identity, per-role scope | the rights of whoever signed in |
| an audit trail of every agent action | nothing, or stdout |
| a stable contract against the vendor's API | a login page that changes without notice |
| a data-protection answer for a DPO | the student's session cookie in a config file |

🟢 **Exactly one address read as institution-grade** — [nitsuah/bb-mcp](https://github.com/nitsuah/bb-mcp)
(MIT): official REST API, OAuth2, role gate, FERPA handling, PII scrub, JSON audit log, Prometheus
metrics, grade write-back (maintainer self-claims, read not executed). **One in twelve.**

🔵 **The consequence for a studio, and it is a sellable one.** The scarce artefact in LMS
integration is no longer a permissive server — it is a **hardened** one. The work is: take a granted
community server, put tenant auth, role scoping, rate limiting and an audit trail around it, and
pin it to the vendor's documented API rather than its login page. That is a small, well-bounded
engagement with a deliverable the client can show their data-protection officer, and it is
available on **every** major LMS as of this pass. 🔴 On D2L it is still partly greenfield: all six
granted Brightspace servers are student-side.

🔴 **And the methodological trend underneath it, because it will recur in every industry in this
rotation:** a census that counts **addresses** and a census that counts **grants** are different
measurements, and the first one silently masquerades as the second. *"Nine servers and not one
verified grant"* described this base's own reading, not the world — the honest word for a count of
zero reads is **unread**, never **ungranted**.

## Trend 1 — Adoption is finished. Governance is the market.

**88–95% of students and faculty already use AI; 26–54% can name a governing policy.**
That gap, not the adoption curve, is what 2026–27 budget buys.

- Coursera (n=4,200, 5 countries): **95%** using AI academically, **26%** of educators report a
  formal institutional policy.
- EDUCAUSE 2026: only **54%** are aware of *any* policy or guideline.
- Ellucian (n=779): institutional adoption **49% → 66%** year on year, with **data privacy the top
  barrier**.
- Digital Education Council (n=45,398, 35 countries): **88%** of students, **77%** of faculty.

- 🆕 `p384` **UNESCO IESALC** (n=**200 institutions, 19 countries**, Sept 2026): **87%** of LAC
  higher-ed institutions use AI in at least one area — **74%** in teaching and learning, **57%** in
  research — against **26%** with a formal AI strategy. 🟢 **An independent, institutional source
  landing on the same 26%** as Coursera's educator-reported figure, in a different region with a
  different method. The governance gap is no longer an inference from one survey; it replicates.
- 🆕 **OECD TALIS 2024** puts teacher AI use at **~50%+** in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Costa Rica
  against an **OECD average of 36%**; Uruguay's **Ceibal** reports **75%** of public-school
  teachers. 🔵 Practitioner uptake is running ahead of the OECD mean in LATAM — the governance gap
  is widest exactly where adoption is fastest, which is the opposite of the usual assumption.

**So:** stop selling introduction. Sell policy-to-configuration, audit trails and a governed
gateway. The shadow-AI estate already exists on every campus. 🟢 And sell it **hardest in LATAM**,
not last — the 87%/26% split there is the widest measured in this file.

## Trend 2 — The ROI reckoning arrived, and procurement is being rewired around evidence

- **~80%** of institutions are investing in AI; **29%** of CTOs say it met or exceeded ROI
  expectations (Inside Higher Ed / Hanover).
- **~7 in 10 provosts** use AI weekly themselves; **1 in 10** report a centralised institutional
  strategy. Personal adoption has outrun institutional capability.
- The **US Department of Education's "Dear Colleague" letter** tells states to evaluate ed-tech by
  **measurable learning outcomes rather than screen time**, and to put **evidence requirements into
  procurement**.
- **US/Canada faculty intent to keep using AI fell 76% → 67%** in one year.

**So:** a before/after measurement on the client's own subject mix is becoming a procurement
precondition, not a nice-to-have. [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness),
MMLU and GSM8K are all MIT; there is no licence reason not to ship this with every engagement.

## Trend 3 — Regulatory divergence hardened in 2026. One global configuration is no longer viable.

Four regimes moved in four different directions in a single year:

| region | 2026 direction |
|---|---|
| **EU** | **Regulation (EU) 2026/1744** (OJ 24 Jul 2026) pushed high-risk education systems from 2 Aug 2026 to **2 Dec 2027** — while **Art. 50 transparency still starts 2 Aug 2026** and **Art. 4 AI literacy has bound every school since 2 Feb 2025**. Emotion recognition in education: prohibited. 🆕 `p385` **The nearest date is neither of those: machine-readable marking of AI-generated content on systems ALREADY on the market is due 2 Dec 2026.** Annex I (AI embedded in regulated products) moves to **2 Aug 2028**. |
| **US** | No federal rule; **134+ bills across 31 states**, **33–35 states** with guidance, and binding district-policy mandates (Idaho SB 1227 effective 1 Jul 2026; Oklahoma SB 1734 by 2027-28). |
| **India / China** | **Content labelling and provenance**: India's amended IT Rules from **20 Feb 2026**; China's labelling measures from **1 Sep 2025** (988 services filed by 30 Jun 2026). |
| **Vietnam / Brazil / Mexico** | **Sectoral high-risk designation**: Vietnam names education among six high-risk sectors; Brazil's PL 2.338/2023 reportedly covers student selection; Mexico replicates the EU risk model. |

**So:** regional configuration is now a product requirement. The same tutor needs provenance
watermarking for India, a transparency notice for the EU, a prohibited-uses lockout for DC, and a
teacher-facing-only mode for ANZ and Brazil.

🆕 `p385` **Two corrections to how this trend gets sold.** First, **the EU deferral is widely
misread as breathing room.** It defers the *high-risk* regime; it defers nothing for a system already
deployed, which owes machine-readable marking on **2 Dec 2026**. A client told "the EU moved to 2027"
and nothing else has been misinformed about the only date within the current budget year. Second,
**employment-adjacent AI is separating from student-facing AI as its own regulated surface**:
**Illinois SB 2909** restricts AI in *teacher* evaluation from **1 Jan 2027**, where DC had only a
non-mandatory ban. A product that evaluates staff is a different compliance object from one that
teaches learners, and the two are still being scoped as one in most pitches.

## Trend 4 — Restriction is a real countertrend, not noise

For two years the only direction was adoption. In 2026 the brake appeared:

- **District of Columbia** 2026-27 policy bans AI from **grading, discipline, IEP decisions and
  teacher evaluations** — four of the highest-value automation targets.
- **Ipsos Education Monitor 2026:** **Australia and New Zealand show the highest support for
  banning AI in schools**, while Asian markets show the lowest. One company, two opposite mandates.
- **European Schools:** **no** generative AI tool approved for system-wide use.
- 🔴 **UNCONFIRMED:** a reported **New York City moratorium** on student-facing generative AI
  (EdWeek; date metadata inconsistent). If it holds, the largest US district has gone the other way.

**So:** "student-facing optional" should be an architectural switch from day one, not a retrofit.
A product that cannot run teacher-facing-only is unsellable in a growing share of the market.

## Trend 5 — Teacher-facing is beating student-facing where growth is fastest

HolonIQ's **2026 LATAM EdTech 100** finds regional AI positioning concentrated in **teacher-facing
instructional tools rather than consumer tutoring** — Teachy (Brazil) in lesson preparation, Ginia
(Mexico) in employability. The regulation points the same way: Brazil's draft law targets
**student selection**, DC bans AI in grading and discipline, ANZ sentiment is restrictive.

**So:** the market and the regulator agree for once. Lesson preparation, assessment drafting,
feedback generation and administrative load carry the growth and avoid the hot zone.

## Trend 6 — The permissive-licence frontier runs *across* the stack, not along it

Measured first-hand this pass over 58 live repositories:

- **Platform tier is copyleft**: Moodle GPL-3.0, Open edX AGPL-3.0, Canvas AGPL-3.0, Chamilo
  GPL-3.0, ILIAS GPL-3.0, Tutor AGPL-3.0, Frappe LMS AGPL-3.0, Sakai ECL-2.0, Opencast ECL-2.0,
  OpenEduCat LGPL-3.0, H5P GPL-3.0.
- **Exactly one permissive major LMS**: **[OpenOLAT](https://github.com/OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT),
  Apache-2.0** — and no roundup we read mentions it.
- **Agent tier is permissive almost throughout**: MIT / Apache-2.0 / BSD-3.

**So:** the architecture follows from the licences. Compose permissive agents **over** a copyleft
platform across **LTI 1.3**, **MCP** or web services — never fork the platform. The interop boundary
is a legal artefact as much as a technical one.

## Trend 7 — MCP reached the LMS, and that is genuinely new

As of 2026 the LMS is addressable by agents without a fork:

- **Moodle's own plugin directory** carries **`webservice_mcp`**, exposing Moodle's external
  functions as **MCP tools over JSON-RPC 2.0** — **Moodle 4.5–5.2**, latest release
  **23 Jul 2026**, gated on the `webservice/mcp:use` capability.
- **Canvas** is served by community MIT servers ([r-huijts/canvas-mcp](https://github.com/r-huijts/canvas-mcp),
  fork [mdweaver/canvas-mcp](https://github.com/mdweaver/canvas-mcp)).
- 🔴 **No official server from Instructure or Moodle HQ**, and two of the most-advertised community
  Canvas/Moodle servers are **unlicensed** — see [`agents/top.md`](../agents/top.md).
- **12 distinct education MCP server slugs are shelved** and verified first-hand this pass, and
  across both agent shelves **MCP reaches **6 distinct LMS platforms**** — Canvas, Moodle, Google
  Classroom, Blackboard, Brightspace/D2L and Open edX. The cumulative harvest behind that is
  lopsided: **35 Canvas servers and 20 Moodle**, against **2 for Open edX**; **Blackboard has 9
  with not one verified grant and D2L has 6 with the only one checked ungranted.** The work on
  Canvas and Moodle is *selection*; on Blackboard and D2L a permissively-licensed server would be
  a real contribution.

**So:** the integration cost of an LMS-aware agent dropped by an order of magnitude this year, and
the remaining risk moved from engineering to licensing.

## Trend 8 — Measurement gap in this pass, stated rather than papered over

**No popularity metric is published this pass.** Every star channel was closed in this sandbox:
`api.github.com` 403, `github.com` HTML 403, `img.shields.io` blocked, `api.star-history.com`
blocked. The technology cycle (`v76`) had to publish a correction that earlier cycles' star counts
were **pipeline-inflated across several industries**; carrying unverifiable numbers forward would
repeat that error. Licence, default ref and liveness **were** verified first-hand for all 58 live
addresses — see [`verified-repos`](../evidence/verified-repos.2026-10-22-p383.tsv).

**So:** rank by licence permissiveness, maintenance signal and fit. Popularity was never the
decision criterion for a studio engagement anyway.

## Trend 9 — 🆕 `p384` The curriculum-data layer arrived, and its licence is a *database* licence

**Every adaptive-learning pitch rests on knowing what a learner must master before the next topic.
Until this pass, no shelf here held that artefact. Now one does — and it is not licensed like code.**

[withmarbleapp/os-taxonomy](https://github.com/withmarbleapp/os-taxonomy) `v1` publishes **1,930
micro-topics** and **4,102 prerequisite edges** as a DAG — each edge tagged `hard`/`soft` with a
one-line reason — over **9 subjects**, aligned to **NGSS, Common Core, the UK National Curriculum**
and the Australian curriculum. Its grant, read first-hand at `main/LICENSE` (25,289 B), is the
**Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL)**. There is **no separate code grant**.

**Why this is a trend and not just a row.** Every licence question these shelves have answered so
far was a **copyright** question about code: can we link to it, can we ship closed extensions. ODbL
is a **share-alike database right**, and it draws its line in a different place:

- **§4.3 — a *Produced Work*** (the tutor's output: a lesson plan, a next-topic choice, an
  explanation) needs **an attribution notice and nothing else**. 🟢 This is the permissive path.
- **§4.4 — a *Derivative Database*** (the client's topics merged in, standards remapped, the graph
  re-cut) must be publicly used **only** under ODbL, a later ODbL, or a compatible licence. §4.4(b)
  is explicit that extracting *"the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents into a new
  database"* **is** a Derivative Database. 🔴 This is the trap, and it is the thing a studio would
  naturally do next.

🔴 **A licence scanner pointed at code will not see this at all.** Neither will a licence badge:
ODbL is not in the permissive/copyleft taxonomy these shelves have been using, so the row cannot be
classified green or red — it is **green on one axis and red on the other, depending on what you
ship**. `Pattern L` was built for the case where a badge misreports a code grant; this is the case
where the *category* is wrong.

**So:** three concrete consequences.
1. **Ground on it, do not fork it.** Keep client curriculum data in a separate store joined at
   query time, so the taxonomy stays an **input** rather than a component of the deliverable. That
   is **Pattern H** in [`compose/patterns.md`](../compose/patterns.md).
2. **Add a data-rights question to intake.** Alongside "what licence is the code", ask "what rights
   govern the **data** we ground on". Education runs on standards, item banks and curriculum maps —
   this will not be the last ODbL/CC-BY-SA artefact on these shelves.
3. **Check coverage before promising it.** The maintainers state their own gap: teaching research
   covers **1,049** topics (Science and Mathematics) and **881 topics have none**. A
   research-backed-guidance claim is true for roughly half the graph.
