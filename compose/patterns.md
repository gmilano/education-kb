# Education — compose patterns

**Pass 132, 2026-10-11.** p131's seven recipes retained; 🔴 **P2 is re-based on a real 39 444-star
stack instead of a greenfield build** and **P8 and P9 are added** from the SIS/portal tier found
this pass (see `README.md` → Pass 132). Nine recipes. Each names the actual repos, the licence
posture of the result, how the pieces wire together, and what it does not solve. Repos cited are
verified in `evidence/verified-repos.2026-10-11.tsv` and
`evidence/verified-repos.2026-10-11-p132.tsv`.

## P1 — Auditable AI tutor on an existing LMS *(the default engagement)*

**For:** an institution whose students already use AI and whose board now wants control.
**Timeline:** 8–10 weeks to pilot.

**Stack**

| layer | component | licence |
|---|---|---|
| tutoring engine | [`HKUDS/DeepTutor`](https://github.com/HKUDS/DeepTutor) | Apache-2.0 |
| mastery + decision audit | [`ArnaudGuiovanna/tutor-mcp`](https://github.com/ArnaudGuiovanna/tutor-mcp) | MIT |
| LMS connector | [`vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp`](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp) (Canvas) | MIT |
| launch into LMS | [`instructure/ims-lti`](https://github.com/instructure/ims-lti) (LTI 1.3) | MIT |
| mastery reference model | [`CAHLR/OATutor`](https://github.com/CAHLR/OATutor) (BKT) | MIT |

**Wiring.** The agent runs *outside* the LMS and is launched via LTI 1.3, so no platform source is
touched and **no AGPL reciprocity is triggered** — this is the point of the pattern. `canvas-mcp`
gives the agent tools over courses, assignments, submissions and rubrics. `tutor-mcp` holds the
state DeepTutor lacks: per-learner BKT mastery, review scheduling, misconception records, and an
append-only log of *why* each pedagogical decision was made. Grades return to the LMS through LTI
grade passback, never by the agent writing directly to the gradebook.

**Why the audit log is the deliverable.** T1/T2 in `intel/trends.md`: the client's problem is
defensibility. "The agent recommended this exercise because mastery of skill S was estimated at
0.42" is reviewable by a human; "the model suggested it" is not.

**Result licence:** fully permissive (Apache-2.0 + MIT). Shippable as a closed derivative.

**Does not solve:** whether learning improves (see P6). Canvas-specific — for Moodle, swap the
connector for a GPL-3.0 plugin or `onbirdev/moodle-webservice_mcp` (**unlicensed — clear first**).

---

## P2 — Offline-first tutor for low-connectivity deployments *(re-based by p132: the slot is occupied, and that is good news)*

**For:** rural LATAM, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia; ministries and NGOs.
**Timeline:** 10–12 weeks.

**Stack**

| layer | component | licence |
|---|---|---|
| 🆕 **orchestration (start here)** | [`Crosstalk-Solutions/project-nomad`](https://github.com/Crosstalk-Solutions/project-nomad) | **Apache-2.0** |
| education platform | [`learningequality/kolibri`](https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri) *(NOMAD's education container)* | MIT |
| reference library | **Kiwix** *(NOMAD's Information Library — offline Wikipedia and books)* | GPL-3.0 family |
| local inference | **Ollama** *(NOMAD's AI Assistant; external OpenAI-compatible endpoint also supported)* | MIT |
| content pipeline | [`learningequality/studio`](https://github.com/learningequality/studio) | MIT |
| mastery state | [`ArnaudGuiovanna/tutor-mcp`](https://github.com/ArnaudGuiovanna/tutor-mcp) | MIT |
| interactive content | [`h5p/h5p-interactive-video`](https://github.com/h5p/h5p-interactive-video) | MIT |
| single-machine pilot | [`karissafuller/project-nomad-macos`](https://github.com/karissafuller/project-nomad-macos) | 🟡 UNREAD |

🔴 **Re-based by p132. Do not build this stack from parts — it exists.** Earlier versions of this
pattern called the slot unclaimed and specified an integration of Kolibri + a local model from
scratch. [`Crosstalk-Solutions/project-nomad`](https://github.com/Crosstalk-Solutions/project-nomad)
(**Apache-2.0, 39 444★**, 850 commits) already orchestrates exactly those pieces as Docker
containers: Kiwix for the library, **Kolibri for the education platform**, Ollama for the AI
assistant. It is the second-largest repo in this KB.

**Wiring, revised.** Stand up NOMAD first and confirm the three containers on the client's target
hardware — that is now a deployment task, not an integration project. Then add the two things NOMAD
does not do: **`tutor-mcp` for durable learner state** (BKT mastery, review scheduling,
misconceptions) persisted locally and reconciled on next sync, and **H5P activities** authored
through Kolibri Studio so the same content survives a later move to Moodle or Open edX. Pilot on a
single machine with the macOS port before committing to the Docker estate.

**Why this remains the strategically strongest pattern in the KB — more so now.** Permissive top to
bottom (Apache-2.0 orchestration over MIT components; **check Kiwix's GPL-3.0 terms if you intend to
modify it rather than run it**), and **data never leaves the device**, which discharges most of the
privacy obligation in US state law, the EU AI Act and Brazil's pending PL 2338 by construction
rather than by policy. 🟢 **The difference from the old version is commercial: the client is buying
weeks of deployment and curriculum work on a proven stack, not months of integration risk.** That
is an easier sale and a defensible one.

**Timeline, revised:** **5–7 weeks** (was 10–12), because the integration layer is no longer yours
to build.

**Result licence:** Apache-2.0 orchestration over MIT components; audit Kiwix if modified.

**Does not solve:** small-model quality is still the binding constraint — scope to one subject and
validate before widening. Still requires device-management capability the client may not have.
🔴 **And the opportunity gap is now geographic, not technical: nothing offline targets LATAM.**
The one curriculum-specific offline project found is Indian
([`Tushar-cy/Offline-AI`](https://github.com/Tushar-cy/Offline-AI)), so a Spanish- or
Portuguese-curriculum NOMAD deployment is unclaimed, permissively licensed, and now cheap.

## P3 — Policy-to-implementation compliance layer *(North America, hard deadlines)*

**For:** a US district or university facing a mandate — e.g. **Ohio's 1 July 2026 policy
requirement**, California AB 1159's ban on training with student data, Oklahoma/Maryland human-
oversight rules.
**Timeline:** 6–8 weeks.

**Stack**

| layer | component | licence |
|---|---|---|
| tool inventory | LMS connectors as discovery instruments: [`vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp`](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp), [`bruchris/canvas-lms-mcp`](https://github.com/bruchris/canvas-lms-mcp) | MIT |
| decision log | [`ArnaudGuiovanna/tutor-mcp`](https://github.com/ArnaudGuiovanna/tutor-mcp) | MIT |
| sandboxing | [`openedx/codejail`](https://github.com/openedx/codejail) | Apache-2.0 |
| no-source-touch integration | [`instructure/ims-lti`](https://github.com/instructure/ims-lti) | MIT |

**Wiring.** Three artefacts, in order. **(1) Inventory:** enumerate via the LMS API every external
tool, LTI registration and integration touching student data — most institutions cannot currently
produce this list. **(2) Routing with proof:** put every model call behind one gateway that records
destination, payload class and retention terms, so "no student data reached a training endpoint" is
a query result, not an assurance. **(3) Gates:** any high-stakes output — grades, placement,
discipline, admissions — is advisory only and requires recorded human approval, satisfying
Oklahoma/Maryland-style rules and aligning with the EU's eventual Annex III duties.

`codejail` sandboxes learner- or model-generated code if the engagement includes auto-grading for
programming courses.

**Result licence:** permissive.

**Does not solve:** the policy text itself (that is counsel's work). This builds the technical means
to comply with it and the evidence of compliance.

---

## P4 — EMEA conformity-by-design build *(before December 2027)*

**For:** an EU institution that will fall under Annex III when high-risk duties apply.
**Timeline:** 10–12 weeks.

**Stack**

| layer | component | licence |
|---|---|---|
| platform | [`ILIAS-eLearning/ILIAS`](https://github.com/ILIAS-eLearning/ILIAS) or [`chamilo/chamilo-lms`](https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms) or Moodle | GPL-3.0 |
| public portal | [`openfun/richie`](https://github.com/openfun/richie) | MIT |
| step-level feedback | [`ideas-edu/ideas`](https://github.com/ideas-edu/ideas) | Apache-2.0 |
| mastery audit | [`ArnaudGuiovanna/tutor-mcp`](https://github.com/ArnaudGuiovanna/tutor-mcp) | MIT |
| integration | LTI 1.3 via [`instructure/ims-lti`](https://github.com/instructure/ims-lti) | MIT |

**Wiring.** Build to the obligations **already in force**, not the postponed ones: Article 4 AI
literacy (since February 2025) and the **prohibition on emotion recognition in education** (since
2 February 2025). Architecturally: no affect/emotion inference anywhere in the system — products
built for other markets ship it and it is illegal here; grading and admissions remain human
decisions with the agent advisory only, which keeps the deployment out of the heaviest Annex III
duties by design; `ideas-edu/ideas` provides deterministic, domain-reasoned step-level feedback for
maths and logic, which is defensible to a regulator in a way LLM free-text is not; Richie (MIT,
proven at French national scale) fronts it.

**Why ILIAS/Chamilo rather than Canvas.** EMEA procurement runs on these, scores standards and
accessibility compliance in tenders, and neither has any AI-on-top — an open field.

**Watch:** Council adoption of the Digital Omnibus. If it fails, the original high-risk dates snap
back and this timeline compresses hard.

**Does not solve:** no open-source proctoring or academic-integrity system exists, and proctoring is
squarely Annex III. Do not promise it.

---

## P5 — Teacher-capacity tooling at national scale *(APAC mandates)*

**For:** ministries and large private networks facing curriculum mandates — **India from Class 3 in
2026-27**, China from age six.
**Timeline:** 8–10 weeks to a usable generator; longer to scale.

**Stack**

| layer | component | licence |
|---|---|---|
| content generation | [`satvik314/educhain`](https://github.com/satvik314/educhain) | MIT |
| pedagogy/skill library | [`GarethManning/education-agent-skills`](https://github.com/GarethManning/education-agent-skills) | **NOASSERTION — review first** |
| interactive output | [`h5p/h5p-interactive-video`](https://github.com/h5p/h5p-interactive-video) | MIT |
| platform | [`frappe/lms`](https://github.com/frappe/lms) or Moodle | AGPL-3.0 / GPL-3.0 |
| delivery at scale | [`learningequality/kolibri`](https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri) where connectivity is poor | MIT |

**Wiring.** The bottleneck in a national mandate is teachers, not students: curriculum, lesson
plans, question banks and assessments in volume, in local languages. `educhain` generates the
artefacts; the skills library supplies pedagogical structure; output is authored as **H5P** so it
renders on whatever platform each state or network runs. Human review stays in the loop per
artefact — content entering a national curriculum needs a named approver, and India's AI-content
labelling rules apply to generated material.

**Licence caution, twice.** `educhain` publishes **no GitHub releases** and its README's version
history stops at **v0.3.13 (October 2024)** — pin a commit and expect to maintain it.
`education-agent-skills` reads as **NOASSERTION**: read the terms before any client reuse.

**Does not solve:** teacher training itself. ~a quarter to a third of the APAC public wants AI out
of classrooms (Ipsos 2026), so adoption is a change-management problem, not a software one.

---

## P6 — Learning-outcome evaluation harness *(the instrument exists; it is unshippable)*

**For:** any client who will be asked "did it work?" — and the differentiator none of them can
currently buy.
**Timeline:** 4–6 weeks, runs alongside P1–P5.

**Stack**

| layer | component | licence |
|---|---|---|
| mastery ground truth | [`CAHLR/OATutor`](https://github.com/CAHLR/OATutor) (BKT) | MIT |
| decision + mastery log | [`ArnaudGuiovanna/tutor-mcp`](https://github.com/ArnaudGuiovanna/tutor-mcp) | MIT |
| structured lesson model | [`oppia/oppia`](https://github.com/oppia/oppia) | Apache-2.0 |
| interaction telemetry | [`jcputney/scorm-again`](https://github.com/jcputney/scorm-again) (xAPI) | MIT |
| multi-agent baseline | [`GeminiLight/gen-mentor`](https://github.com/GeminiLight/gen-mentor) | CC0-1.0 |
| **pedagogical benchmark** | [`eth-lre/mathtutorbench`](https://github.com/eth-lre/mathtutorbench) (ETH Zurich, EMNLP 2025 oral) | 🔴 **none declared** — run/cite only |
| **failure-mode dataset** | [`Khan/tutoring-accuracy-dataset`](https://github.com/Khan/tutoring-accuracy-dataset) (Khan Academy) | 🔴 **bespoke eval-dataset licence** — run/cite only |

**Wiring.** 🔴 **p130 built this pattern on the claim that no benchmark exists. Two do** (T7), and
starting from them removes weeks of design — so this pattern is now *two layers*, and the licence
boundary between them is the whole point.

**Layer 1 — borrow the published task structure (do not ship it).** Run `mathtutorbench` against
the candidate tutor for open-ended *pedagogical* capability (scaffolding, hint quality, when to
withhold the answer), and use `Khan/tutoring-accuracy-dataset` as the known-failure-mode set for
maths tutoring. 🔴 **Neither may be redistributed inside a client deliverable**: `mathtutorbench`
declares no licence and its README names two different ones, Khan's is a bespoke 2 690-byte
"Evaluation Dataset License". **Run them in your own environment, report the scores, ship neither
the data nor a derived fixture set.** If the client needs a shippable suite, re-author the task
*shapes* against their own curriculum — the ideas are not the asset, the labelled data is.

**Layer 2 — build the outcome half, which genuinely does not exist.** Both benchmarks measure tutor
behaviour, not whether a student learned. BKT parameters from `OATutor` give a quantitative,
inspectable mastery estimate independent of the tutor's self-assessment; `tutor-mcp` logs every
decision with the mastery state that produced it; xAPI via `scorm-again` captures interaction
telemetry from existing courseware so a pre-intervention baseline exists; Oppia's lesson model
encodes misconceptions explicitly, giving labelled targets to measure against. Run a holdout: same
content, tutor on and off, compare mastery trajectories and retention at a fixed interval.

**Why it closes every other pattern.** The OECD's 2026 Outlook asks for **durable learning gains**;
US state mandates ask for evidence that high-stakes decisions were sound; EU Annex III will ask for
documented performance. One harness answers the pedagogical question and three regulatory ones.

**Does not solve:** it measures, it does not teach. It needs a holdout design the institution must
agree to — negotiate that at contract time, not at delivery. 🔴 **And the two borrowed benchmarks
are maths-only**: for any other subject, Layer 1 has no published instrument and the shapes must be
authored from scratch.

---

## P7 — Moodle agent on the permissive side of the GPL boundary *(the route p130 said did not exist)*

**For:** any client on Moodle — the most deployed LMS in the world — that wants an AI layer it can
own, without taking on GPL-3.0 reciprocity on its own code.
**Timeline:** 5–7 weeks.

**Stack**

| layer | component | licence | why this one |
|---|---|---|---|
| platform (untouched) | [`moodle/moodle`](https://github.com/moodle/moodle) | GPL-3.0 | Left entirely alone. **Nothing is forked and no plugin is written**, so no reciprocity is triggered. |
| connector | [`peancor/moodle-mcp-server`](https://github.com/peancor/moodle-mcp-server) | **MIT** | Standalone MCP server against Moodle's **web-service API**. Verified MIT by two independent instruments. 🔴 **Quiet since 2026-02-22 and publishes no tags — pin a commit.** |
| assessment + gradebook | [`ictinnovations/ictexam-mcp`](https://github.com/ictinnovations/ictexam-mcp) | **MIT** | Exams, gradebooks, item analysis, with **writes off by default** — the right default for anything touching grades. Corporate holder, LTI path. |
| durable learner state | [`ArnaudGuiovanna/tutor-mcp`](https://github.com/ArnaudGuiovanna/tutor-mcp) | **MIT** | BKT mastery, review scheduling, misconception tracking, auditable pedagogical decisions. LMS-agnostic. |
| launch surface | [`instructure/ims-lti`](https://github.com/instructure/ims-lti) | **MIT** | LTI 1.3 launch with signed identity and grade passback, so the UX lives inside Moodle while the code lives outside it. |
| build velocity | [`SaadRahman01/moodle-mcp`](https://github.com/SaadRahman01/moodle-mcp) + [`claude-moodle-dev`](https://github.com/SaadRahman01/claude-moodle-dev) | **MIT** | Live moodledev.io docs, Hooks API, XMLDB and Jira as agent tools; plus plugin-building skills if a plugin ever does become necessary. |

**Wiring.** Moodle's web-service API is the whole trick: enable the web-service functions the use
case needs, issue a scoped token per service, and point the MIT MCP servers at it. The agent gets
courses, assignments, submissions and grades as tools; `tutor-mcp` holds the mastery state between
turns so the tutor is not re-deriving the learner from the transcript each time; `ictexam-mcp`
handles anything assessment-shaped with writes explicitly enabled only where a human approves.
Learner-facing UX enters through **LTI 1.3**, not a plugin. **Every line Globant writes stays MIT or
client-proprietary**; the only GPL-3.0 artefact in the deployment is Moodle itself, unmodified.

**Why this pattern exists.** p130's pages told a reader that Moodle had *no permissively licensed
MCP route* and that the options were a GPL-3.0 in-tree plugin or an unlicensed web-service plugin.
That was false in both directions, and the cost of the error is the whole engagement shape: it
pushes a client toward writing a GPL plugin when a clean-room MIT side-car was available.

**Checks before proposing it.** Confirm the client's Moodle has web services enabled and tokens
issuable — some managed hosts disable them. Pin commits (`peancor` has no tags). Keep grade writes
behind human approval: automated grading is **Annex III high-risk** in the EU from 2027-12-02 and is
restricted by several US state rules now (`intel/policy-matrix.tsv`).

**Does not solve:** deep in-page Moodle UX. If the client insists the AI live inside a Moodle
activity rather than an LTI launch, a GPL-3.0 plugin becomes unavoidable — and the reciprocity is on
the plugin, not the client's other code.

---

## P8 — Sanctioned connector for a national school platform *(new, p132 — EMEA's clearest unmet need)*

**For:** the vendor or ministry behind a national K-12 platform — **Librus** (Poland), **EduPage**
(Slovakia/Czechia), **Pronote** (France), **IServ** (Germany) — or a large school group running one.
**Timeline:** 8–10 weeks.

🔵 **Why this pattern exists.** p132 found that all four platforms already have open-source MCP
connectors, mostly MIT, written by pupils and parents — and **every one is an unofficial
password-scraper with no DPA, no audit trail, and (for `librus-mcp`) no 2FA support**. The vendors
have no agent story at all. So the work is not *"can an agent reach this platform"* — that is proven
and published — it is *"make it legitimate"*.

**Stack**

| layer | component | licence | role |
|---|---|---|---|
| API surface map | [`krzysztofbury/librus-mcp`](https://github.com/krzysztofbury/librus-mcp) · [`oliverhruby/edupage-mcp`](https://github.com/oliverhruby/edupage-mcp) · [`HAL-XP/mcp-pronotes`](https://github.com/HAL-XP/mcp-pronotes) · [`chenning42/iserv-mcp`](https://github.com/chenning42/iserv-mcp) | MIT *(🔴 `librus-mcp`: MIT 2.x only — `legacy_reference/` is **GPL-3.0-only**)* | 🟢 **read as documentation**; keep the endpoint map, discard the auth |
| identity | [`barneslardo/sis-demo`](https://github.com/barneslardo/sis-demo) as the reference shape — Okta OIDC/SAML, OAuth 2.0, **SCIM** | 🔴 unlicensed — **pattern only, do not vendor the code** | replaces the stored pupil password |
| audit | [`zavora-ai/mcp-student-records`](https://github.com/zavora-ai/mcp-student-records) FERPA-logging approach | **Apache-2.0** (payload-read) | per-access logging a regulator can read |
| policy gate | [`ArnaudGuiovanna/tutor-mcp`](https://github.com/ArnaudGuiovanna/tutor-mcp) for auditable pedagogical decisions | MIT | keeps inference out of high-stakes calls |
| launch surface | [`instructure/ims-lti`](https://github.com/instructure/ims-lti) where the platform speaks LTI | MIT | avoids touching platform source |

**Wiring.** Lift the endpoint map from the existing MIT connectors — that is the weeks of
undocumented-API archaeology you do not repeat. Replace the credential model wholesale: the agent
authenticates through the platform's own SSO with scoped, revocable tokens provisioned by SCIM, and
**never holds a pupil credential**. Every read is logged with actor, subject, field and purpose.
Write operations stay off by default; grade and attendance writes require a human confirmation step.
Ship it as a vendor-sanctioned integration, not a scraper.

🔴 **The compliance work is the deliverable, not overhead.** For all four platforms the subjects are
children, so: a **DPA with the vendor**, a lawful-basis analysis, a **DPIA**, data-minimised scopes
(a timetable agent does not need disciplinary records), and retention limits. Annex III of the AI
Act is not triggered by reading a timetable — but it *is* triggered the moment the same connector
feeds grading or admissions, which is the second phase every client will ask for. **Architect the
boundary now** (`P4`).

**Result licence:** your own code; MIT inputs read as reference only. 🔴 **Do not vendor
`sis-demo`** (unlicensed) or `librus-mcp`'s `legacy_reference/` (GPL-3.0-only).

**Does not solve:** it needs the platform vendor at the table. Without their cooperation this is
still a scraper, and should not be built. 🟢 **The pitch to the vendor is that pupils are already
scraping them with stored passwords and no 2FA** — a sanctioned surface is a security improvement
for the vendor, not just a feature.

---

## P9 — Administrative automation on an open-source system of record *(new, p132 — the real hole)*

**For:** institutions running, or willing to adopt, an open-source SIS/ERP — mid-size universities,
school groups, ministries. **Timeline:** 10–12 weeks.

🔵 **Why this is the sharpest opportunity in the KB after p132.** The SIS *agent* gap is closed —
there are 21 connectors — but **every single one targets a proprietary or institution-hosted
portal.** The open-source systems of record have **zero** agent coverage between them, while
administrative automation remains the most-cited adoption driver. **The connector effort has gone to
the platforms a studio cannot fork and avoided the ones it can.**

**Stack**

| layer | component | licence | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| system of record | [`academico-sis/academico`](https://github.com/academico-sis/academico) | **MIT** | 🟢 **the only permissive SIS** — the one base a client can own as a closed derivative |
| — or — | [`openeducat/openeducat_erp`](https://github.com/openeducat/openeducat_erp) | **LGPL-3.0** (payload-read) | broadest functional coverage; **linking is fine**, modifying the module carries reciprocity |
| — or — | [`frappe/education`](https://github.com/frappe/education) | 🔴 **read `LICENSE` first** (API says `NOASSERTION`) | pick when the client already runs ERPNext |
| agent scaffold | [`sandraschi/classroom-mcp`](https://github.com/sandraschi/classroom-mcp) | **MIT** | 🟢 standalone, ~42 tools, teaching-agent roles — **the reference design to read** (1★; do not depend on it) |
| optimiser | [`saytooyum/AI-Based-Timetable-Generation-System`](https://github.com/saytooyum/AI-Based-Timetable-Generation-System) | **MIT** | conflict-free timetabling under India's NEP 2020 — the only real optimiser found |
| audit | [`zavora-ai/mcp-student-records`](https://github.com/zavora-ai/mcp-student-records) | **Apache-2.0** | FERPA-style per-access logging |
| identity | SCIM/OIDC per [`barneslardo/sis-demo`](https://github.com/barneslardo/sis-demo) | 🔴 unlicensed — pattern only | institutional SSO, scoped tokens |

**Wiring.** Pick the system of record on the licence question first, because it is irreversible:
**`academico` (MIT)** if the client wants to own a closed product, **`openeducat_erp` (LGPL-3.0)** if
they want coverage and will call it from outside without modifying it. Put an MCP server in front of
it modelled on `classroom-mcp`'s tool taxonomy — students, enrolment, assignments, courseware,
progress — reading through the platform's own permission model rather than around it. Attach the
timetable optimiser as a *tool the agent calls*, not as something the model does: scheduling is a
constraint-satisfaction problem and an LLM is the wrong instrument for it. Wrap everything in
per-access logging and SCIM-provisioned scoped tokens from day one.

🟢 **The commercial shape is better than the tutoring engagements.** Timetabling, enrolment and fee
chasing have a measurable baseline (hours of registrar time, scheduling conflicts per term, days to
produce a timetable), so the business case writes itself — unlike tutoring, where the client is
buying an unproven learning-outcome claim (`P6`). And the regulatory exposure is far lower: **a
timetable is not Annex III.**

**Result licence:** MIT throughout if built on `academico`; LGPL-3.0 linking obligations if on
`openeducat_erp` and the module is modified.

**Does not solve:** 🔴 **the client has to be willing to run an open-source SIS**, and most
institutions of record run a proprietary one — which is why the 21 connectors target those instead.
Realistically this lands at mid-size institutions, new campuses and ministry programmes rather than
at a university replacing Banner or SITS. 🔴 **Both scaffold rows are 1★** — read them as reference
designs and expect to own the code.

## Pattern selection, one line each

| if the client… | run |
|---|---|
| already runs Canvas/Moodle and wants control | **P1** |
| serves low-connectivity learners | **P2** |
| faces a US state mandate with a date | **P3** |
| is an EU institution touching admissions/grading | **P4** |
| is a ministry facing a curriculum mandate | **P5** |
| will be asked whether it worked | **P6** — always, alongside the others |
| runs **Moodle** and wants to own its AI layer | **P7** |
| is the **vendor** of a national K-12 platform, or runs one at scale | 🆕 **P8** |
| wants **administrative** automation and will run open-source as its record | 🆕 **P9** |

**Cross-cutting constraints.** Prefer **LTI 1.3** over forking any AGPL platform. Never ship
emotion recognition into an EU deployment. Treat unlicensed components as unusable
until counsel clears them, however many stars they have — and treat **`NOASSERTION` as "unread",
not "unusable"**: GitHub reports it whenever its matcher does not recognise a `LICENSE` file, and
this KB has resolved at least one such row (`openeducat_erp` → **LGPL-3.0**, 8 241 B) by reading the
payload. Pin commits for repos with no releases. **Benchmarks and datasets need the same licence
screen as code** — the two education benchmarks that exist are both ungranted.

🆕 **Three cross-cutting rules added by p132:**

1. 🔴 **Distinguish three licence states, never conflate them.** **Granted-but-unmatched**
   (`NOASSERTION` over a real grant — `mcp-student-records` is **Apache-2.0** carried as a
   ~745-byte notice block; `openeducat_erp` is **LGPL-3.0** at 8 241 bytes), **silent** (no licence
   file — `sisu-mcp`, `sis-demo`, `DAU-buddy`), and **deliberately withheld**
   (`graduation-project-advisor`: *"Private / TBD"*). Only the first is buildable.
2. 🔴 **Check for mixed licences inside a single repo.** `krzysztofbury/librus-mcp` is **MIT at
   2.x** over a `legacy_reference/` directory that remains **GPL-3.0-only**. A whole-repo fork
   inherits the stricter term; exclude the directory or do not fork.
3. 🔴 **Never adopt a student-built portal connector as a dependency.** They authenticate as the
   pupil with a stored password against an unsanctioned platform, and the ones that work are the
   ones with 2FA disabled. 🟢 **Read them for the API surface map, then rebuild the auth layer**
   (`P8`).
