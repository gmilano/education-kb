# Compose Patterns — Education

Concrete recipes built only from repos verified in `agents/top.md`,
`repos/foundations.md` and `verticals/solutions.md` on 2026-10-06. Every
component names its license, because in this industry the license decides the
architecture.

**The rule behind all six patterns:** the education platform shelf is mostly
copyleft (Moodle GPL-3.0, Open edX / Canvas / Frappe AGPL-3.0). AI built as an
in-tree plugin inherits that license; the same AI built as an external service
over LTI 1.3 or MCP stays permissive. Globant's reusable IP lives in the
side-car.

---

## P1 — LTI + MCP side-car tutor (the default engagement shape)

**Use when:** the client already runs an LMS, which is almost always.
**Outcome:** AI tutoring inside the existing LMS, with Globant's code permissive.

**Wiring:**
1. Leave the LMS untouched — Moodle (GPL-3.0), Canvas (AGPL-3.0) or Open edX
   (AGPL-3.0). No fork, no in-tree plugin.
2. Register a tool provider with
   [IMSGlobal/LTI-Tool-Provider-Library-PHP](https://github.com/IMSGlobal/LTI-Tool-Provider-Library-PHP)
   (Apache-2.0) for launch, identity and grade passback.
3. Expose LMS data to the agent over MCP:
   [vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp) (MIT,
   102 tools, 8 agent skills) for Canvas, or
   [peancor/moodle-mcp-server](https://github.com/peancor/moodle-mcp-server)
   (MIT) for Moodle.
4. Tutoring engine: [HKUDS/DeepTutor](https://github.com/HKUDS/DeepTutor)
   (Apache-2.0) via its WebSocket API or Python SDK, one TutorBot workspace per
   learner so memory is per-student.
5. Orchestrate with [langchain-ai/langgraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)
   (MIT); type every boundary with [pydantic/pydantic-ai](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai) (MIT).
6. Serve models through [ollama/ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) (MIT)
   when residency is required, or a commercial API when it is not.

**Why this order:** step 1 is what keeps steps 4–6 permissive. Reverse it — write
a Moodle plugin — and the tutor becomes GPL-3.0 and stops being reusable IP.

**Watch:** LTI grade passback is a consequential decision path. Put the P4
human-oversight gate in front of it before any grade is written back.
**Effort:** 6–8 weeks for a single-LMS pilot.

---

## P2 — Curriculum ingestion → item bank

**Use when:** the client has curriculum in PDFs and textbooks and needs
assessment items or lesson content at volume.

**Wiring:**
1. [opendatalab/MinerU](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU) (Apache-2.0)
   parses PDFs, textbooks and scanned material into structured text.
2. [satvik314/educhain](https://github.com/satvik314/educhain) (MIT) generates
   MCQs, open-ended items, lesson plans and flashcards from that text.
3. Validate every generated item against a schema with pydantic-ai (MIT) —
   reject rather than repair malformed items.
4. Route items into the LMS question bank: Moodle qbank, or Open edX via
   [overhangio/tutor](https://github.com/overhangio/tutor) (AGPL-3.0) for
   deployment.
5. **Human review before any item goes live.** Not optional — see below.

**Hard constraint:** there is no permissive open source auto-grader (declared gap,
re-searched 2026-10-06). Generate items and feedback automatically; keep scoring
human-gated. This also satisfies Oklahoma/Maryland human-oversight statutes and
EU AI Act Annex III.
**Effort:** 4–6 weeks.

---

## P3 — Mastery-tracked adaptive practice

**Use when:** the client needs adaptive sequencing *and* has to justify why a
learner was judged to have mastered something.

**Wiring:**
1. [CAHLR/OATutor](https://github.com/CAHLR/OATutor) (MIT) supplies Bayesian
   Knowledge Tracing — an inspectable, parameterised mastery estimate per skill,
   published at CHI '23 with follow-up in PLOS ONE.
2. LangGraph (MIT) runs the per-skill state machine: practice → BKT update →
   branch to remediation, hinting or advance.
3. DeepTutor (Apache-2.0) generates hints and explanations at the remediation
   node; its Capabilities layer is the right place for a multi-turn
   remediation dialogue.
4. Persist BKT parameters and LangGraph checkpoints together — that pairing *is*
   the audit record of why the system decided what it decided.

**Why BKT rather than asking a model:** under EU AI Act high-risk assessment
rules and Brazil's PL 2.338 risk tiers, "the LLM said so" is not a defensible
mastery claim. A BKT posterior with known priors is.
**Effort:** 6–10 weeks.

---

## P4 — EMEA sovereign, Annex III-ready deployment

**Use when:** EU client, assessment or access decisions in scope. The AI Act
defers stand-alone high-risk obligations to **2 December 2027** — that deferral
is the design window, not a reason to wait.

**Wiring:**
1. Inference stays in-region: ollama (MIT) or vLLM on-prem, open-weight models
   (Llama, Mistral). No student data to a third-party API.
2. pydantic-ai (MIT) for typed, schema-validated outputs at every boundary —
   structured decisions are auditable, prose is not.
3. LangGraph (MIT) checkpoints as the immutable decision trail: inputs, model
   version, intermediate state, output, timestamp.
4. OATutor (MIT) BKT for any mastery or progression claim, so the assessment
   logic is explainable independently of the model.
5. **A human-oversight gate as a required graph node** before any grade, access
   or progression decision is committed. The gate records who approved what.
6. [1EdTech/openbadges-validator-core](https://github.com/1EdTech/openbadges-validator-core)
   (Apache-2.0) if competency claims leave the institution.

**Deliverable is two things:** the system, and the Annex III conformity
documentation it generates. Sell both.
**Effort:** 10–14 weeks. Reuses directly for Brazil PL 2.338 readiness.

---

## P5 — Offline-first equity deployment (LATAM and low-connectivity)

**Use when:** connectivity, device or budget constraints are real — which per
CEPAL covers much of LATAM, where >50% of Chilean and Brazilian teachers already
use AI but <10% of institutions have the capacity to support it.

**Wiring — a fully MIT stack, no copyleft anywhere:**
1. [LearningEquality/kolibri](https://github.com/LearningEquality/kolibri) (MIT)
   as the platform; runs offline on a classroom server or a single laptop.
2. [LearningEquality/studio](https://github.com/LearningEquality/studio) (MIT)
   for curriculum authoring and channel curation.
3. [LearningEquality/ricecooker](https://github.com/LearningEquality/ricecooker)
   (MIT) to package existing client or ministry content into Kolibri channels.
4. ollama (MIT) with a small quantised model on the local server for offline
   tutoring and question answering — no egress, no per-token cost.
5. Sync opportunistically when connectivity appears; never assume it.
6. For Spanish-first public-sector clients that require a conventional LMS
   instead, substitute [chamilo/chamilo-lms](https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms)
   (GPL-3.0) — accepting the copyleft, and keeping the AI as a P1 side-car.

**Positioning:** pair with UNESCO's LAC AI-in-Education Observatory (launched
14 April 2026) and lead with teacher enablement and governance, which is the
measured gap, rather than with software alone.
**Effort:** 4–6 weeks for a pilot site; the content pipeline dominates.

---

## P6 — Client capability build (enablement)

**Use when:** the client's own staff must own the system afterwards — which is
how an engagement becomes a programme rather than a project.

**Wiring:**
1. [microsoft/ai-agents-for-beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-agents-for-beginners)
   (MIT, 18 lessons) as the core track; its samples target MAF, which is the
   framework you want taught.
2. [huggingface/agents-course](https://github.com/huggingface/agents-course)
   (Apache-2.0) as the second track for framework-agnostic grounding, and
   [panaversity/learn-agentic-ai](https://github.com/panaversity/learn-agentic-ai)
   (MIT) for a cohort-tested syllabus.
3. [microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners)
   (MIT) as the prerequisite for non-AI staff;
   [rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch)
   (Apache-2.0) or [mlabonne/llm-course](https://github.com/mlabonne/llm-course)
   (Apache-2.0) for the deep track.
4. [jupyterhub/jupyterhub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub)
   (BSD-3-Clause) to give the whole cohort an identical environment on day one.
5. Teach on **Microsoft Agent Framework (MIT)**, not AutoGen — AutoGen is in
   maintenance mode and will not receive new features.

**Effort:** 3–4 weeks to stand up, then runs continuously.

## Pattern selection

| Situation | Pattern |
|---|---|
| Client already has an LMS | P1 |
| Needs content or item volume from existing curriculum | P2 |
| Must justify mastery/progression decisions | P3 |
| EU client, assessment in scope | P4 (P1 for the integration) |
| Connectivity/budget constrained, equity mandate | P5 |
| Client staff must own it afterwards | P6, alongside any other |

## Anti-patterns

- **Writing an in-tree LMS plugin for reusable IP.** It inherits GPL-3.0/AGPL-3.0.
  Use P1.
- **Promising autonomous grading.** No permissive auto-grader exists, and three
  regulatory regimes require human oversight on consequential decisions.
- **Specifying AutoGen.** Maintenance mode; `LICENSE` at HEAD is CC-BY-4.0.
- **Taking `frappe/lms` as MIT.** It is AGPL-3.0 at `license.txt`; the comparison
  blogs are wrong.
- **Pinning a DeepTutor fork.** `cloudtoolbox/deeptutor` (7★) and others mirror
  the description and license without the history. Pin `HKUDS/DeepTutor`.
- **Treating an APAC sovereign model as an education product.** They are base
  models with no pedagogy layer; that layer is the work.
