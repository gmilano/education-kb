# Education — composition patterns

Concrete recipes. Each names the specific repos, the licence boundary that makes the
composition safe, and what the engagement actually delivers. Every repo referenced is
verified live with its grant read from payload on **2026-10-21** — see
`agents/top.md` and `repos/foundations.md`.

**The rule that governs all of these.** Most education platforms are GPL or AGPL.
Reaching them **over a protocol boundary** — LTI 1.3, web services, or MCP — keeps a
client's proprietary work on its own side of the licence. Forking them does not.
Every pattern below is built on a boundary, deliberately.

## Pattern 1 — LMS-native tutor without touching the LMS

**Problem.** A university runs Canvas or Moodle. They want an AI tutor grounded in
their actual courses. They cannot accept AGPL obligations on their own code, and IT
will not approve a fork.

**Recipe.**
1. **Reach the LMS over MCP**, not code: [`vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp`](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp) (MIT) for Canvas, [`falkenslab/moodle-mcp`](https://github.com/falkenslab/moodle-mcp) (MIT) for Moodle, [`ArnaudGuiovanna/tutor-mcp`](https://github.com/ArnaudGuiovanna/tutor-mcp) (MIT) for Open edX.
2. **Tutoring logic** from [`CAHLR/OATutor`](https://github.com/CAHLR/OATutor) (MIT) — Bayesian Knowledge Tracing gives defensible mastery estimates instead of vibes.
3. **Pedagogical behaviour** loaded as skills from [`anthropics/k12-teacher-skills`](https://github.com/anthropics/k12-teacher-skills) (Apache-2.0) or [`learning-commons-org/agent-skills`](https://github.com/learning-commons-org/agent-skills) (Apache-2.0).
4. **Surface it in the LMS** as an LTI 1.3 tool via [`Cvmcosta/ltijs`](https://github.com/Cvmcosta/ltijs) (Apache-2.0, Node) or [`dmitry-viskov/pylti1.3`](https://github.com/dmitry-viskov/pylti1.3) (MIT, Python). On Canvas specifically, [`harvard-edtech/caccl`](https://github.com/harvard-edtech/caccl) (MIT) removes most of the boilerplate.
5. **Quality-gate the output** with [`learning-commons-org/evaluators`](https://github.com/learning-commons-org/evaluators) (MIT code).

🟢 **Licence boundary:** every component is MIT or Apache-2.0. The AGPL platform is
reached over MCP and LTI, so its copyleft never touches client code.

## Pattern 2 — BNCC-aligned lesson planner for Brazil

**Problem.** A Brazilian ministry, network or EdTech needs lesson planning provably
aligned to the national BNCC curriculum. Generic AI output cannot be defended to a
regulator or a school board.

**Recipe.**
1. **Ground in official standards:** [`bncc-dev/bncc-dados`](https://github.com/bncc-dev/bncc-dados) (MIT) — **1 721 BNCC learning objectives** as JSON/SQLite/CSV. Load it as the retrieval corpus so every generated plan cites a real objective code.
2. **Generate the courseware** with [`satvik314/educhain`](https://github.com/satvik314/educhain) (MIT) for course structure, or [`SYuan03/Skill-Anything`](https://github.com/SYuan03/Skill-Anything) (MIT) to turn existing material into quizzes and flashcards.
3. **Render as interactive content** teachers can still edit: [`h5p/h5p-cli`](https://github.com/h5p/h5p-cli) (**MIT** — note the core library is GPL-3.0, the CLI is not) or [`openpatch/hyperbook`](https://github.com/openpatch/hyperbook) (MIT).
4. **Deliver into the school's system:** [`francoisjacquet/rosariosis`](https://github.com/francoisjacquet/rosariosis) (GPL-2.0) for K-12 SIS, or [`chamilo/chamilo-lms`](https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms) (GPL-3.0) — both with mature Portuguese/Spanish localisation. Integrate over web services to keep the boundary.
5. **Pull supporting public data** via [`Mcp-Brasil/mcp-brasil`](https://github.com/Mcp-Brasil/mcp-brasil) (MIT).

🟢 **Why this is defensible:** the alignment claim is checkable against a public MIT
dataset, objective by objective. 🔴 **And why it does not yet port:** no equivalent
open dataset exists for Mexico's SEP, Colombia's or Argentina's standards. Building
one is the regional asset play — see `intel/market.md` → LATAM.

## Pattern 3 — EU AI Act high-risk conformity wrapper

**Problem.** A European institution uses AI in admissions or assessment. That is a
**high-risk** system under EU AI Act **Annex III point 3**, and the obligations — risk
management, data governance, logging, human oversight — bind from **2 December 2027**,
postponed from 2 August 2026 by the Digital Omnibus (**Regulation (EU) 2026/1744**, in
force 27 July 2026). Their current tooling has none of it.

🔵 **Scope the engagement on the real date.** Telling this client they are bound *now*
is wrong by sixteen months and in the expensive direction. What binds them today is the
**prohibitions**, the **AI-literacy duty** and **Article 50 transparency**. The
high-risk work is a **readiness programme with a fixed, non-extendable deadline** — a
better engagement than emergency remediation, and an honest one.

**Recipe.**
1. **Instrument every decision.** Wrap the model call so each inference writes an
   immutable record: inputs, model version, output, the human who reviewed it. Emit
   it on the **Caliper** event vocabulary — implement [`1EdTech/caliper-spec`](https://github.com/1EdTech/caliper-spec) 🔴 (an **IMS specification licence**: implement the standard, do not vendor the document).
2. **Force human oversight structurally**, not by policy: the agent proposes, a named
   human disposes, and the gate is in the data model. [`byerlikaya/Septum`](https://github.com/byerlikaya/Septum) (MIT) is a working reference for the approval-gate shape — local PII detection → approval → de-anonymisation.
3. **Evidence of efficacy and non-discrimination:** run the model as a randomised
   experiment inside the LMS with [`terracotta-education/terracotta`](https://github.com/terracotta-education/terracotta) (Apache-2.0). This produces the outcome data the Act's risk-management file needs, and the efficacy proof procurement now demands (see `intel/trends.md` §2).
4. **Accessibility obligations in the same pass:** [`ucfopen/UDOIT`](https://github.com/ucfopen/UDOIT) (GPL-3.0) inspects course content; have the agent generate remediations rather than only flagging.
5. **Host on a permissive platform** so the conformity layer can be a closed
   deliverable: [`OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT`](https://github.com/OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT) (**Apache-2.0**) is the only full HE platform where this is clean.

🟢 **This is the strongest opportunity in the KB.** Obligations are live, and a survey
of 450+ institutions put formal AI guidelines at ~10 %.

---

## Pattern 4 — Assessment integrity for the agent era

**Problem.** Students submit agent-assisted work. Detection-by-vibes is both unfair
and indefensible, and most "AI detectors" do not survive scrutiny.

**Recipe.**
1. **Measure similarity, not "AI-ness":** [`dodona-edu/dolos`](https://github.com/dodona-edu/dolos) (MIT, Ghent University) does structural source-code plagiarism detection. It makes a claim you can show a student.
2. **Execute submissions safely:** [`judge0/judge0`](https://github.com/judge0/judge0) (GPL-3.0) sandboxes 60+ languages — consume it **as a service over its API** so the GPL boundary holds.
3. **Grade deterministically:** [`ls1intum/Ares2`](https://github.com/ls1intum/Ares2) (MIT, TU Munich) for secure test execution, or [`INGInious/INGInious`](https://github.com/INGInious/INGInious) (AGPL-3.0, 🟡 *"most of the files"* — mixed grant, diligence it) as a full assessment platform.
4. **Shift the assessment design itself.** Pair the above with process evidence —
   version history, in-editor telemetry from [`SJRiz/pytogether`](https://github.com/SJRiz/pytogether) (MIT) — so the artefact is no longer the only evidence.
5. **Model the mastery signal:** [`pykt-team/pykt-toolkit`](https://github.com/pykt-team/pykt-toolkit) (MIT) and [`ZhijieXiong/pyedmine`](https://github.com/ZhijieXiong/pyedmine) (MIT) for knowledge tracing over the resulting data.

🔵 **Position it honestly:** this detects *similarity and process anomalies*, not
authorship. Say so to the client; the alternative is a product that fails its first
appeal.

---

## Pattern 5 — Offline-first delivery for low-connectivity regions

**Problem.** Rural LATAM, Sub-Saharan Africa, remote APAC. Intermittent or no
connectivity, shared low-end devices, and no frontier-model budget per learner.

**Recipe.**
1. **Platform:** [`learningequality/kolibri`](https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri) (**MIT**) — purpose-built offline-first, syncs when a link appears. MIT means the deployment can be a closed, branded client deliverable.
2. **Precompute, do not infer live.** Generate the full adaptive content tree
   server-side with [`satvik314/educhain`](https://github.com/satvik314/educhain) (MIT) or [`CaviraOSS/PageLM`](https://github.com/CaviraOSS/PageLM) (MIT), then ship it as a Kolibri channel. Inference cost becomes a one-time build cost.
3. **Local mastery model:** [`CAHLR/OATutor`](https://github.com/CAHLR/OATutor) (MIT) — BKT runs on-device with no network call.
4. **Spaced repetition instead of generation:** [`HumphreySun98/Smart-Study-Agent`](https://github.com/HumphreySun98/Smart-Study-Agent) (MIT) pairs RL action-selection with FSRS scheduling; [`ankimcp/anki-mcp-server`](https://github.com/ankimcp/anki-mcp-server) (MIT) where Anki is already in use.
5. **Literacy-specific base:** [`elimu-ai/webapp`](https://github.com/elimu-ai/webapp) (MIT) for early-grade literacy in African deployments.
6. **Mobile client:** fork [`moodlehq/moodleapp`](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodleapp) (**Apache-2.0** — permissive, unlike Moodle core) for a branded learner app.

🟢 **Every component is MIT or Apache-2.0.** This whole pattern can ship as a closed
deliverable, which matters for ministry and NGO procurement.

## Pattern 6 — Modernising a legacy SCORM corporate estate

**Problem.** An enterprise has thousands of hours of SCORM content, an LMS that
serves it, and no appetite to re-author any of it. They want AI on top.

**Recipe.**
1. **Keep the content, wrap the runtime:** [`jcputney/scorm-again`](https://github.com/jcputney/scorm-again) (MIT) is a modern SCORM 1.2/2004 JS runtime. It replaces the player, not the courseware, and its MIT grant lets you instrument it freely.
2. **Harvest the signal.** The SCORM runtime already emits completion, score and
   interaction data. Route it to a learning-record store on the **xAPI/Caliper**
   vocabulary — this is where the AI gets its training and personalisation signal,
   and it costs nothing to collect.
3. **Layer an agent over the catalogue:** [`virgiliojr94/book-to-skill`](https://github.com/virgiliojr94/book-to-skill) (MIT) is the closest working pattern for turning static documents into agent-loadable skills; apply the same shape to course PDFs and manuals.
4. **Fill gaps rather than rebuild:** generate only the missing modules with [`assafkip/claudemy`](https://github.com/assafkip/claudemy) (MIT) or [`sitor-ai/frametell`](https://github.com/sitor-ai/frametell) (AGPL-3.0 — 🔴 keep it a separate service if the client needs closed code).
5. **Corporate-academy platform** where a new one is needed: [`classroomio/classroomio`](https://github.com/classroomio/classroomio) (AGPL-3.0) or [`frappe/lms`](https://github.com/frappe/lms) (AGPL-3.0) — both copyleft, so run them as deployed services, not embedded code.

---

## Pattern 7 — Curriculum knowledge graph from raw textbooks

**Problem.** A client has textbooks and syllabi but no machine-readable curriculum
model, so nothing can be sequenced, diagnosed or aligned.

**Recipe.**
1. **Extraction pipeline:** [`clownjee/knowledge-import-pipeline`](https://github.com/clownjee/knowledge-import-pipeline) (Apache-2.0) does exactly this — PDF parsing → concept extraction → vector retrieval → prerequisite-edge construction → **MCP query service**. It is the only verified end-to-end implementation of this shape.
2. **Skeleton to align against:** [`withmarbleapp/os-taxonomy`](https://github.com/withmarbleapp/os-taxonomy) (ODbL-1.0 — 🟡 share-alike binds a derivative *database*, not a produced work) or [`aclascollege/polymath`](https://github.com/aclascollege/polymath) (ODbL-1.0 + CC-BY-SA-4.0) for disciplines, courses, prerequisites, skills and careers.
3. 🔴 **Do not seed from [`cn-math-taxonomy`](https://github.com/xiaoyang111222/cn-math-taxonomy)** despite it being the best Chinese K-12 graph available (1 244 nodes, 5 123 items). It is **CC-BY-NC-4.0** and cannot be used in paid work. Use it to validate your own graph's shape, never as an ingredient.
4. **Serve it to agents over MCP** so the graph is a boundary-crossing asset reusable
   by every downstream tutor, planner and diagnostic.
5. **Diagnose against it:** [`pykt-team/pykt-toolkit`](https://github.com/pykt-team/pykt-toolkit) (MIT) for knowledge tracing over the prerequisite structure.

🟢 **Why this is the durable play.** Agents are commoditising fast; the curriculum
graph underneath them is proprietary, defensible and compounding. See
`intel/trends.md` §9.

---

## Pattern 8 — Verifiable credentials for skills-based hiring

**Problem.** A client wants to issue credentials employers can verify without calling
the registrar, and tie them to demonstrated skills rather than seat time.

**Recipe.**
1. **Wallet and issuance:** [`openwallet-foundation-labs/learner-credential-wallet`](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation-labs/learner-credential-wallet) (MIT, OpenWallet Foundation) — the open reference implementation for verifiable learner credentials.
2. **Skills vocabulary to issue against:** [`withmarbleapp/os-taxonomy`](https://github.com/withmarbleapp/os-taxonomy) (ODbL-1.0) maps skills to careers, which is what makes a credential legible to an employer.
3. **Evidence behind each claim:** assessment results from Pattern 4, carried as
   Caliper/xAPI records so a credential points at verifiable evidence rather than a
   grade letter.
4. **Issue from the LMS** over LTI via [`tsugiproject/tsugi`](https://github.com/tsugiproject/tsugi) (Apache-2.0) or [`openfun/marsha`](https://github.com/openfun/marsha) (MIT).

🔵 1EdTech names credentials a core 2026 mechanism for skills-based learning and
hiring; this is the open stack for it.

## 🆕 Pattern 9 — A licence-clean programming-assessment stack for a coding academy

**Client shape.** A bootcamp, CS department, certification body or developer academy
that must run untrusted student code, grade it, detect copied submissions and report
results into an LMS the client already owns — and the deliverable has to ship inside a
closed engagement.

**Why this pattern did not exist one pass ago.** The only execution component this base
carried was `judge0` (GPL-3.0), so every version of this build had a copyleft component
at its centre. `p356`'s function legs found a **larger MIT alternative**.

**The stack, every grant read from the payload on 2026-10-21:**

1. **Execution and verdicts** — [`QingdaoU/OnlineJudge`](https://github.com/QingdaoU/OnlineJudge)
   (🟢 **MIT**, `master/LICENSE`, 6 552 ★). A complete judge: submissions, problem bank,
   contests, admin, Docker deployment. **Fork it and brand it** — the MIT grant reaches
   nothing.
2. **The sandbox underneath it** — [`QingdaoU/Judger`](https://github.com/QingdaoU/Judger)
   (🟢 **MIT**, 🔴 branch **`newnew`**, 496 ★). seccomp-based. Already wired into the row
   above; named separately because if the client has their own platform, **this is the
   only piece they need**.
3. **Notebook and data-science courses** — [`ucbds-infra/otter-grader`](https://github.com/ucbds-infra/otter-grader)
   (🟢 **BSD-3-Clause**, 161 ★, UC Berkeley) for **Python *and* R** notebooks, behind
   [`jupyterhub/jupyterhub`](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub) (BSD-3-Clause) with
   [`jupyterhub/ltiauthenticator`](https://github.com/jupyterhub/ltiauthenticator)
   (BSD-3-Clause) for LMS single sign-on.
4. **Integrity** — [`dodona-edu/dolos`](https://github.com/dodona-edu/dolos)
   (🟢 **MIT**, 353 ★, Ghent University) for source-code plagiarism. 🔵 **Choose this over
   proctoring:** of the five proctoring rows verified this pass, one has no grant, one has
   no identified licensor and two are AGPL plugins to AGPL hosts. Detect what the
   submission *is* rather than surveil the student.
5. **Rubric-bound human-in-the-loop grading** — [`erictrainnlpinxihu/Grader-agent`](https://github.com/erictrainnlpinxihu/Grader-agent)
   (🟢 **MIT**, 101 ★) for the written parts. Its four write actions are **absent from the
   tool table**, so the agent can only emit proposals, and every `GradingDraft` binds to a
   rubric line and a paragraph hash. That is a **structural** approval boundary, which is
   what the EU AI Act's high-risk regime wants for exam scoring (`intel/market.md`, EMEA).
6. **Report back into the client's LMS** — an **LTI 1.3 tool** with
   [`Cvmcosta/ltijs`](https://github.com/Cvmcosta/ltijs) (Apache-2.0) or
   [`dmitry-viskov/pylti1.3`](https://github.com/dmitry-viskov/pylti1.3) (MIT). Never a
   fork of Canvas or Open edX — both are AGPL.

🟢 **Every component is MIT, BSD-3-Clause or Apache-2.0.** The whole stack can ship
inside a closed client deliverable with no copyleft reach — which was not true of this
capability before this pass.

🟡 **When to pick the copyleft alternatives instead.** If the client will host it
themselves and publish nothing of their own, [`hydro-dev/Hydro`](https://github.com/hydro-dev/Hydro)
(AGPL-3.0, 7 137 ★) is better engineering for many courses at once, and
[`mjnaderi/Sharif-Judge`](https://github.com/mjnaderi/Sharif-Judge) (AGPL-3.0, branch
`Version-1`) is the only row actually built for **courses** — assignments, deadlines,
per-student feedback — rather than contests. Both stay the **client's** deployment, not
the studio's product.

🔴 **The two branch traps in this pattern, named because they will bite.**
`QingdaoU/Judger` defaults to **`newnew`** and `Sharif-Judge` to **`Version-1`**. A CI
licence check or a vendoring script that assumes `main` or `master` will report the MIT
sandbox at the centre of this stack as **unlicensed**.

## 🆕 Pattern 10 — Add retention to a tutor that already works

**Client shape.** A client already has a tutor, courseware or study app that generates
good material and cannot show that anyone **remembers** it. Procurement is starting to
ask for evidence of learning rather than evidence of output (`intel/trends.md` §2), and
"the model explained it well" is not an answer.

**The insight.** Every tutoring agent on `agents/top.md` decides *what* to teach next.
Almost none decides *when to come back to it* — and scheduling, not generation, is what
moves retention. The sector has a standard for this, it is small, and it is MIT.

**The stack:**

1. **The scheduler** — [`open-spaced-repetition/py-fsrs`](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/py-fsrs)
   (🟢 **MIT**, 514 ★). A few hundred lines; takes a review outcome and returns the next
   due date. Drop it beside the existing content pipeline without touching it.
2. **The algorithm, to justify it to the client** — [`free-spaced-repetition-scheduler`](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/free-spaced-repetition-scheduler)
   (🟢 **MIT**, 729 ★) is the published DSR-model specification, so the scheduling
   decisions are **explainable to a procurement committee** rather than opaque.
3. **Verification, not self-report** — [`nagisanzenin/engram`](https://github.com/nagisanzenin/engram)
   (🟢 **MIT**, 1 458 ★) does free-recall checking *with receipts*: the learner is
   measured recalling, and the evidence is kept. This is the row that produces the
   artefact an evidence-based procurement wants.
4. **Reach the learner where their cards already are** — [`ankimcp/anki-mcp-server`](https://github.com/ankimcp/anki-mcp-server)
   (🟢 **MIT**) over MCP, or [`kitschpatrol/yanki`](https://github.com/kitschpatrol/yanki)
   (🟡 MIT, declared only in `package.json`) to push markdown into Anki. 🔵 Anki has the
   installed base; do not rebuild it.
5. **Instrument the claim** — [`terracotta-education/terracotta`](https://github.com/terracotta-education/terracotta)
   (Apache-2.0) runs the A/B inside the client's LMS: same content, scheduled versus
   unscheduled, retention measured. **That comparison is the deliverable**, not the
   scheduler.

🟢 **Licence reach: none.** Every component is MIT or Apache-2.0.

🟡 **Two rows to leave out, and why.** [`trane-project/trane`](https://github.com/trane-project/trane)
(848 ★) and [`echo-loop/Echo-Loop`](https://github.com/echo-loop/Echo-Loop) (4 222 ★) are
the most interesting designs in this tier — a mastery dependency graph and a full
listening/speaking trainer — and **both are AGPL-3.0**. Study them; do not embed them in
a hosted client deliverable.

## Boundary cheat-sheet

| If the host platform is… | Reach it by… | Never |
|---|---|---|
| Canvas, Open edX, Frappe LMS, ClassroomIO (**AGPL**) | LTI 1.3 tool · MCP server · web services | Forking, or linking client code |
| Moodle, Chamilo, ELMSLN, Judge0, UDOIT, 🆕 HUSTOJ, 🆕 openSIS Classic (**GPL**) | Web services · the plugin API as a *separate* deployed plugin · the API over HTTP | Statically linking into proprietary code |
| 🆕 Hydro, DMOJ, Sharif Judge, the AGPL item banks (**AGPL**) | The client's own deployment, reached over HTTP | Hosting it as the studio's service |
| BigBlueButton, OpenEduCat (**LGPL**) | Dynamic linking · API | Forking into closed source |
| OpenOLAT, Sakai, Kolibri, Moodle App, Opencast, 🆕 **QingdaoU OnlineJudge**, 🆕 **Judger**, 🆕 **Otter-Grader**, 🆕 **py-fsrs** (**permissive**) | Anything, including forking | — |

**One-line version:** in education, the licence picks the architecture. Decide the
boundary before the stack.
