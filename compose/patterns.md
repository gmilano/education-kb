# Compose patterns — concrete education AI recipes

**Pass `p491` — reads of 2026-10-27.** `p490` (earlier the same day) rewrote this file; `p491`
**extends** it with **`P491-1`**, which supersedes `P490-6`. Pre-p490 sections remain in
[`archive/2026-10-27-p490-pre-rewrite/patterns.md`](../archive/2026-10-27-p490-pre-rewrite/patterns.md).

Every component below is a row verified this pass in [`agents/top.md`](../agents/top.md),
[`repos/foundations.md`](../repos/foundations.md) or
[`verticals/solutions.md`](../verticals/solutions.md) — real repo, license read from bytes at a
pinned SHA.

**Read the licence column as a deployment constraint.** A pattern marked 🟢 can ship as a closed
hosted derivative. A pattern marked 🔴 cannot, and the obligation is named.

## P490-1 — Canvas agent assistant for US higher ed 🟢

**Why:** Canvas dominates US higher ed and is the only incumbent LMS with a maintained agent tool
surface. Fastest path to a working engagement in the largest market.

| Component | Repo | License | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tool surface | [vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp) | MIT | Canvas tools + 8 agent skills over MCP. 🔴 **Pin `v1.16.0` or later** (`p492`) — see the amended threat model below. Tool count is self-inconsistent upstream (102 vs 128): **do not quote one.** |
| Agent loop | [huggingface/smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) | Apache-2.0 | code-writing agent runtime |
| Content generation | [satvik314/educhain](https://github.com/satvik314/educhain) | MIT | quizzes, lesson plans, flashcards |

**Wiring:** run `canvas-mcp` against the institution's Canvas API token → expose as MCP tools to a
`smolagents` agent → `educhain` generates assessment items that the agent writes back through
`canvas-mcp`'s content tools.

**Do this or it is negligent:** start from `canvas-mcp`'s **read-only** tool subset
(`get_*`/`list_*`), enable write tools individually through its operator allowlist, and put a human
gate on anything that writes a grade. Its own source makes the point to honour: *a confirmation
token does not prove a human approved anything.*

🔴 **Amended `p492` — the threat model above was right and is no longer sufficient.** This pattern
previously named **one** advisory as the threat model. `v1.16.0` publishes **four**, and two of them
are not covered by tool scoping at all:

| advisory | subject | what it defeats |
|---|---|---|
| `GHSA-7mj9-4mcg-hvhv` | **Canvas token handling** | 🔴 **Read-only tool scoping does not protect the token.** This pattern hands the server an *institutional* Canvas API token — scoping tools limits what the agent may call, not what a token-handling defect exposes. |
| `GHSA-7pp5-29mw-9jq3` | **local code sandbox** | 🔴 Code execution reachable from an agent loop driven by **student-authored text**. |
| `GHSA-hmr8-mvr2-mvw5` | **file content fencing** | The advisory this pattern already carried. Upstream's words are *file content fencing*, not "prompt-injection path". |
| `GHSA-qf6c-jv93-38gv` | Windows download permissions | Low relevance on Linux hosting; still live. |

**Three additions to the build, not optional:**

1. **Treat the Canvas API token as the primary asset, not the tool scope.** Issue a **dedicated
   service token** scoped to the pilot faculty, hold it in a secret manager the agent process
   cannot read, inject at request time, and **rotate on a schedule set before go-live**. Never the
   institution's admin token.
2. **Isolate the runtime.** With a published sandbox advisory and `smolagents` *writing and running
   code* in this very pattern, the agent process runs in its own container with **no ambient cloud
   credentials** and egress restricted to the Canvas host and the model endpoint.
3. **Pin and watch.** Pin `canvas-mcp` to `v1.16.0`+ by tag, subscribe to its advisories, and
   re-read them at every engagement checkpoint. 🟢 It **has** a `SECURITY.md` and discloses — which
   is why four advisories is a sign of a project worth depending on, not one to avoid. **An
   education MCP server with zero advisories is unexamined, not safe.**

🔵 **Also `p492`:** this pattern's base **drifted** — HEAD moved from this KB's pinned
`32e5d1ca0175` to `830bc2ef8389`, with the licence **byte-identical at both SHAs** (MIT, 1 071 B),
so the change is **code-only**. Pin by release tag rather than tracking `main`.

**Licence note:** Canvas itself is AGPL-3.0, but you are **integrating over its API, not
modifying it** — no obligation attaches. All three components above are permissive. 🟢

**Scope:** 4–6 weeks to a governed pilot on one faculty.

## P490-2 — EU-conformant tutor where Globant is the provider 🟢

**Why:** under the EU AI Act the vendor is the **provider** and carries the conformity duties.
Education tutoring that touches assessment or admissions is high-risk. The Digital Omnibus moved
that deadline to **2 Dec 2027** — but Article 50 transparency still bites **2 Dec 2026**.

| Component | Repo | License | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| LMS base | [OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT](https://github.com/OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT) | **Apache-2.0** | the only permissive full LMS; closed derivative permitted |
| Tutoring engine | [HKUDS/DeepTutor](https://github.com/HKUDS/DeepTutor) | Apache-2.0 | graph-RAG lifelong tutoring |
| Mastery model | [CAHLR/OATutor](https://github.com/CAHLR/OATutor) | MIT | Bayesian Knowledge Tracing — an *auditable* learner model |
| Governance substrate | [panaversity/ksor](https://github.com/panaversity/ksor) | Apache-2.0 | governed, authoritative knowledge with provenance |

**Wiring:** OpenOlat holds courses and enrolments → DeepTutor serves tutoring over course
material → OATutor's BKT maintains per-skill mastery as the explainable learner state → KSoR
holds the authoritative curriculum so every tutor claim is traceable to a source.

**Conformity work that is the actual deliverable:**
1. **Article 50 content marking by 2 Dec 2026** — mark every AI-generated artefact. Nearest
   real deadline.
2. **Human oversight** on assessment and progression decisions; BKT is chosen over an opaque
   model precisely because a learner model that determines an educational path must be explainable.
3. **Technical documentation + logging** from day one — provider duties, not retrofits.
4. 🔴 **Ship no emotion recognition, attention tracking or sentiment detection.** Banned in
   education in the EU since 2 Feb 2025. Audit the roadmap for it.

**Licence note:** all four permissive — closed hosted derivative is clean. 🟢

**Scope:** 10–14 weeks. Verify Omnibus dates against EUR-Lex before contracting.

## P490-3 — Offline-first ministry deployment for LATAM / APAC 🟢

**Why:** LATAM shows the highest measured individual adoption (56% of Brazilian secondary
teachers vs 36% OECD; 92% of LATAM HE students) against the weakest institutional delivery (30%
satisfaction). Public money sits in ministry programmes, and connectivity cannot be assumed.

| Component | Repo | License | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Platform | [learningequality/kolibri](https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri) | **MIT** | offline-first, the only permissive one |
| Lesson structure | [oppia/oppia](https://github.com/oppia/oppia) | Apache-2.0 | explorations with misconception handling |
| Study-pack generation | [SYuan03/Skill-Anything](https://github.com/SYuan03/Skill-Anything) | MIT | source → quizzes + flashcards + SRS |
| SRS scheduling | [ankitects/anki](https://github.com/ankitects/anki) | AGPL-3.0 | **reference only — see note** |

**Wiring:** generate study packages **centrally, online** with `Skill-Anything` over the
ministry's approved curriculum → ship them into Kolibri's offline content channels → Oppia
explorations carry the interactive remediation → spaced repetition schedules review locally with
no network.

**The licence line that matters:** Kolibri, Oppia and Skill-Anything are permissive 🟢. **Anki is
AGPL-3.0** — use it as an *algorithm reference* and implement the scheduler, or accept the AGPL
obligation. Do not vendor Anki code into a closed deployment. 🔴

**Regional fit:** Portuguese/Spanish first. Align to the **UNESCO Observatory on AI in Education
for LATAM & the Caribbean** (launched 14 Apr 2026) and the **CONALEP/DGETI** centre-of-excellence
pilot in Mexico. Note there is **no LATAM AI statute** to sell conformity against — sell delivery.

**Scope:** 8–12 weeks per ministry pilot; content pipeline is the long pole, not the app.

---

## P490-4 — Jurisdiction-routing provenance layer for APAC 🟢

**Why:** APAC is the fastest-growing region (35.3% CAGR) with the least public resistance, but
four incompatible regimes. Content labelling is **mandatory in China and India**, absent in
**Japan**, and South Korea's AI Basic Act has been binding since **22 Jan 2026**. One product
must behave differently per market.

| Component | Repo | License | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Agent loop | [huggingface/smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) | Apache-2.0 | runtime |
| Provenance / authority | [panaversity/ksor](https://github.com/panaversity/ksor) | Apache-2.0 | source-of-truth + provenance records |
| Content generation | [satvik314/educhain](https://github.com/satvik314/educhain) | MIT | material generation |
| Platform | [learningequality/kolibri](https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri) | MIT | delivery |

**Wiring:** every generated artefact gets a KSoR provenance record at creation. A policy module
keyed on deployment jurisdiction then decides the output treatment:

| Market | Behaviour required |
|---|---|
| India | prominent AI label + provenance marker (live **20 Feb 2026**) |
| China | AI-content label + service **filing** before launch |
| South Korea | AI Basic Act obligations (binding **22 Jan 2026**) |
| Japan | no binding duty — label anyway, cost is zero |

**Beachhead:** South Korea for a compliance-first pitch (only comprehensive mandatory APAC law);
India for volume.

**Licence note:** all permissive. 🟢 **Scope:** 12–16 weeks across three markets.

---

## P490-5 — Policy-configurable K-12 assistant for the US patchwork 🟢

**Why:** ~34 states plus DC and Puerto Rico have AI guidance, and the enacted laws demand
*different* things. One assistant with per-district policy configuration beats 34 forks. There is
**no federal law** — H.R. 8747 advanced in committee only, so do not plan around it.

| Component | Repo | License | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| LMS base | [Selleo/mentingo](https://github.com/Selleo/mentingo) | **MIT** | AI-native LMS; multi-tenant via Postgres RLS |
| Content generation | [satvik314/educhain](https://github.com/satvik314/educhain) | MIT | lesson plans, assessments |
| Mastery model | [CAHLR/OATutor](https://github.com/CAHLR/OATutor) | MIT | BKT, explainable |
| Canvas bridge | [vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp) | MIT | where the district runs Canvas |

**Wiring:** `mentingo`'s Postgres **row-level security** is the load-bearing choice — tenant
isolation is enforced in the database, not in application code, so a district is a tenant and its
policy settings cannot leak across. Each tenant carries a policy record:

| Policy toggle | Driven by |
|---|---|
| Parent opt-out | Oklahoma **S.B. 1734** |
| AI-literacy standards + mandatory local policy | Idaho **S.B. 1227** |
| State guidance alignment | Maryland **S.B. 720** |
| Grade-band restriction (e.g. no genAI for K-6) | district rule — Katy ISD pattern |
| Human-oversight gate on high-stakes decisions | recurring across states |
| "Learning aid, not submitted work" | Columbia Law pattern (HE) |

**Licence note:** all four MIT 🟢 — closed hosted derivative is clean, which matters since this is
a SaaS-shaped product.

**Scope:** 6–10 weeks to a two-district pilot.

---

## P490-6 — Open education-AI evaluation harness (build, not compose) 🟡 **— superseded by `P491-1`**

🔵 **Superseded.** Its premise — that *no* education-AI evaluation instrument exists — was refuted
in `p491`: two real benchmarks exist, and they are **unlicensed**. Use **`P491-1`** below, which
keeps this pattern's scoring design but rebases the runtime on a permissive harness instead of
building one. Kept here because the component wiring below is still sound and the two patterns
differ only in their base.

**Why:** this is the sector's largest structural gap. Nobody can currently demonstrate that an AI
tutor improves outcomes. Buyers in all four regions are starting to ask, and EU high-risk
conformity will require evidence by **2 Dec 2027**.

| Component | Repo | License | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ground-truth mastery | [CAHLR/OATutor](https://github.com/CAHLR/OATutor) | MIT | BKT as the reference learner model |
| Item generation | [satvik314/educhain](https://github.com/satvik314/educhain) | MIT | generate assessment items at volume |
| Curriculum authority | [panaversity/ksor](https://github.com/panaversity/ksor) | Apache-2.0 | authoritative answer keys with provenance |
| Harness runtime | [huggingface/smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) | Apache-2.0 | drive candidate tutors under test |
| Subject under test | [HKUDS/DeepTutor](https://github.com/HKUDS/DeepTutor) | Apache-2.0 | first candidate |

**Wiring:** KSoR holds curriculum + answer keys → `educhain` generates held-out item banks →
`smolagents` drives each candidate tutor through simulated learner trajectories → OATutor's BKT
scores mastery gain against the key → report per-skill learning gain, not token overlap.

🟡 **Marked amber deliberately:** unlike P490-1 to P490-5 this composes no existing harness,
because none exists. It is a build on permissive parts. That is also why it is the strongest
differentiator in this file — and it would close the gap this KB has carried for dozens of passes.

**Licence note:** all permissive. 🟢 Could be published as open source as a credibility asset.

**Scope:** 10–14 weeks for v1 on one subject domain.

---

## P491-1 — Tutoring-quality eval harness on a permissive base 🟢 *(supersedes `P490-6`)*

**Why:** `p491` established that the instruments for measuring tutoring quality **exist and carry
no license** — [`mathtutorbench`](https://github.com/eth-lre/mathtutorbench) (45★, EMNLP 2025 Oral)
and [`TutorCaseBench`](https://github.com/kixlab/TutorCaseBench) (0★, KAIST) both ship **no grant
file**, and MathTutorBench's README contradicts itself (`CC BY 4.0` badge vs `CC BY-SA 4.0` text,
neither a software grant). So the research is public and the **code and data are not takeable**.
That is a licensing blocker, not a scarcity one, and it has a clean route around it.

| Component | Repo | License | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Harness runtime | [EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) | **MIT** (1,066 B @ `d6de81643928`) | task registry, model adapters, runners, reporting — 14,300★, the de-facto standard |
| Ground-truth mastery | [CAHLR/OATutor](https://github.com/CAHLR/OATutor) | MIT | BKT as the reference learner model |
| Item generation | [satvik314/educhain](https://github.com/satvik314/educhain) | MIT | held-out item banks at volume |
| Curriculum authority | [panaversity/ksor](https://github.com/panaversity/ksor) | Apache-2.0 | answer keys with provenance |
| Learner simulation | [huggingface/smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) | Apache-2.0 | drive simulated learner trajectories |
| Subject under test | [HKUDS/DeepTutor](https://github.com/HKUDS/DeepTutor) | Apache-2.0 | first candidate tutor |

**Wiring:** implement each pedagogical dimension as a **native `lm-evaluation-harness` task** —
that is the one decision that makes this reusable, because it inherits the harness's model
adapters, caching, reproducible task versioning and result format for free, and anything scored
this way is comparable against general-model baselines. Then: KSoR holds curriculum and answer
keys → `educhain` generates held-out item banks → `smolagents` drives simulated learner
trajectories against the candidate tutor → OATutor's BKT scores **per-skill mastery gain** against
the key → the harness emits the report. Score learning gain, never token overlap.

**The license line that makes this work — read it before writing any code:**

1. 🟢 **Every component above is MIT or Apache-2.0.** The output is a clean closed or open
   deliverable, your choice.
2. 🔴 **Do not vendor `mathtutorbench` or `TutorCaseBench` code or data.** No grant means no
   rights — not permissive-by-default. Cloning for private reading is one thing; shipping their
   code or redistributing their datasets in a client deliverable is another.
3. 🟢 **Reimplement the *task designs* from the papers** (arXiv 2502.18940 for MathTutorBench;
   TutorCaseBench's 5 challenge types). Benchmark methodology published in a paper is readable and
   reimplementable; that is what papers are for. Cite both.
4. 🟢 **Ask the authors to add a license.** Both are academic groups (ETH LRE, KAIST kixlab) and an
   MIT or Apache-2.0 grant is usually a five-minute decision nobody got around to. An upstream
   license would convert this whole pattern from a build into a compose — the highest-leverage
   email in this file.

**Why it is worth building anyway:** EU high-risk conformity needs **evidence of educational
efficacy** by **2 Dec 2027** (`P490-2`), and no buyer in any region can currently get it. A
published, permissively-licensed tutoring-eval harness is a credibility asset that also doubles as
the measurement layer under every other pattern here.

**Scope:** 8–12 weeks for v1 on one subject domain — shorter than `P490-6`'s 10–14, because the
runtime, model adapters and reporting are no longer yours to write.

---

## Patterns deliberately **not** offered

- **Nothing on Moodle or Open edX at the agent layer.** Neither has an MCP/tool surface at a
  usable star floor; the connector is unbudgeted build work. Use P490-1 (Canvas) where possible
  and price the connector explicitly otherwise.
- **No closed SaaS on an incumbent LMS fork.** Moodle is GPL-3.0; Open edX, Canvas, Frappe LMS,
  Tutor **and LearnHouse** (`p491`, 2,400★) are **AGPL-3.0** — hosting a modified copy owes source
  to users. Only OpenOlat, Kolibri, Oppia and mentingo support that shape.
- **Nothing on `frappe/education`** (`p491`, 682★) despite it being a genuine school-management
  base: its grant is a **19-byte stub** naming GPL v3 with no license text, so it is copyleft *and*
  its paperwork will not survive a client's legal review. Named so the omission is visible.
- **Nothing built on an unlicensed benchmark.** `mathtutorbench` and `TutorCaseBench` are the two
  best education-AI instruments in existence and **neither can be composed** — see `P491-1`.
- **No closed SIS or assessment product.** Every SIS found (`rosariosis` GPL-2.0, `GibbonEdu`
  GPL-3.0, `openeducat_erp` LGPL-3.0) and the only real assessment engine (`tao-core` GPL-2.0)
  are copyleft. There is no permissive base — it is a ground-up build.
- **Nothing using `ChatTutor` (AGPL-3.0) or `tutor-gpt` (GPL-3.0)** in a hosted commercial
  pattern, despite both being capable. Named here so the omission is visible rather than silent.


## 🆕 `P492-1` — Grading assistant whose arithmetic the model never touches 🟢

**Why:** every high-risk education regime now converging on the same functional trigger —
**automated assessment or ranking of learners** (EU Annex III; Vietnam Decision `33/2026/QD-TTg`,
3 education systems of 46) — demands demonstrable human oversight from the **provider**. And
[`intel/market.md`](../intel/market.md) establishes that **for a Globant-built education AI system,
Globant is the provider.** The cheapest way to fail a conformity assessment is to let an LLM
compute a grade total.

| Component | Repo | License | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reference design | [vulinh1704/ai-tutor-agent](https://github.com/vulinh1704/ai-tutor-agent) | MIT | 🔵 **read, do not depend** (0★, 13 commits) — the rubric/leak-guard/thread architecture below |
| Agent runtime | [langchain-ai/langgraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) | **MIT** (1 072 B, `sha1 73a6ebe3bd93` @ `eb8ec111b3e9`) | explicit per-session thread with checkpointed state |
| Rubric item generation | [satvik314/educhain](https://github.com/satvik314/educhain) | MIT | generates the rubric criteria and assessment items |
| LMS write-back | [vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp) | MIT | **`v1.16.0`+**, write tools behind a human gate |
| Quality harness | [eth-lre/mathtutorbench](https://github.com/eth-lre/mathtutorbench) | 🔴 **no software grant** | 🔵 measure against it; **do not vendor it** — see [`agents/top.md`](../agents/top.md) |

**Wiring — the whole point is the split:**

1. `educhain` emits the **rubric** (criteria + weights + max points) as data, reviewed by a human
   **once per assignment**, then frozen and version-pinned.
2. The model is asked for **per-criterion structured output only** — a score and a feedback string
   per criterion, validated against the frozen rubric schema with Pydantic. **A response that does
   not validate is rejected and retried, never coerced.**
3. 🟢 **The total is computed in Python from the validated per-criterion scores.** The model is
   never asked for, and never shown, a total. This is the single load-bearing decision.
4. **Socratic mode gets the answer-leak guard:** a draft hint that reveals the answer is
   regenerated under a stricter instruction; if it still leaks, a safe canned hint replaces it.
   Hints escalate one level at a time.
5. Session state is an **explicit LangGraph thread** (SQLite for a pilot), so every grade carries a
   replayable trace — which is what an oversight duty actually asks for.
6. `canvas-mcp` writes the grade back **only after a human gate**, per `P490-1`'s amended rules
   (dedicated scoped token, isolated runtime, pinned release).

**What makes this conformant rather than merely careful:** the arithmetic is deterministic and
auditable, the rubric is human-approved before any student is graded, every score decomposes to a
criterion with a rationale, and the trace is replayable. 🟢 **An EU-conformant build of this
transfers to Vietnam with little rework** — the functional trigger is the same, which is why this
KB's standing advice is to build conformity **once, in EMEA shape, and reuse it**.

🔴 **Do not propose the reference repo as a dependency.** One author, 13 commits, zero stars, no
security process. Its value is that it is a **1 071-byte MIT grant over an architecture worth
copying** — the first open implementation of advice this KB has given for several passes without
being able to point at code.

🔵 **Honest gap:** `mathtutorbench` measures tutoring quality and **ships no software licence**
(its own README names two different Creative Commons variants, neither a software grant). Use it as
an **external yardstick you run against**, never as vendored code. There is still **no usable
open-source education-AI evaluation harness** — see `T11`.

**Scope:** 5–7 weeks to a governed pilot on one course, including the rubric-freeze workflow and
the oversight trace. Add 2–3 weeks if the conformity documentation is a deliverable.
