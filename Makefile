# `ACTION SW` (p229) and `ACTION QO` (carried ELEVEN passes) — the licence gate stops being
# a one-off and becomes a STANDING check.
#
# `ACTION QO` was registered eleven passes running as "wire a licence gate into make hooks".
# p227 inverted its scope to *check the SHELVES against first-hand payloads*; p228 BUILT
# exactly that and ran it over 520 slugs — as a one-off, by hand. `ACTION SW` registered the
# remaining half, and this file is it.
#
# 🔴 Why it never became standing before, measured at p229: THE SUITES ONLY PASS FROM THEIR
# OWN DIRECTORY. `python3 -I compose/code/p228-shelf-gate/test_shelf_gate.py` dies on
# `ModuleNotFoundError: classify_grant` because `-I` strips the script's directory from
# `sys.path`, while the same file passes 30/30 from inside its folder. That is
# `p355-cwd-portability`'s class, and it is the whole reason a working gate stayed a
# one-off: it could not be invoked from the place a hook runs. Every recipe below therefore
# `cd`s into the instrument, and the ONLINE half stays out of `hooks` so the check is
# runnable where there is no egress.
