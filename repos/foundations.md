# Foundational Education Repos

**Pass `p526` · 2026-10-29.** Every row read first-hand from its repository page
this pass. These are the load-bearing systems an education engagement is likely
to inherit, extend or integrate against — not agents (those are in
[`../agents/top.md`](../agents/top.md)), but the platforms the agents must live
beside.

> **Licence reality for this sector, stated plainly:** the mainstream education
> platforms are **copyleft**, not permissive. Moodle is GPL-3.0, Open edX and
> Canvas are AGPL-3.0. A targeted search for a mainstream Apache/MIT LMS returned
> none. This is not a gap in the research — it is the shape of the market, and it
> drives the architecture: **build permissive agents that integrate across a
> process or network boundary** (LTI, xAPI, REST, MCP) rather than forking an
> AGPL core and inheriting its obligations.

## Platform cores

| Repo | Licence | Stars | Why it is foundational |
|---|---|---|---|
| [bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton) | LGPL-3.0 | 9.3k | "A complete web conferencing system for virtual classes." README names **BigBlueButton 4.0**; default branch `v4.0.x-develop`. The default synchronous-classroom layer, and it is already integrated into Moodle, Canvas and Open edX. LGPL is the friendliest copyleft here. |
| [openedx/openedx-platform](https://github.com/openedx/openedx-platform) | AGPL-3.0 | 8.2k | The Open edX LMS + Studio authoring core. *(Note: `openedx/edx-platform` now redirects here — use the `openedx-platform` address.)* The reference choice for MOOC-scale and large corporate-training deployments. |
| [moodle/moodle](https://github.com/moodle/moodle) | GPL-3.0 | 7.6k | "The world's open source learning platform." PHP, `main` branch, 123k+ commits. Largest plugin ecosystem in the sector by a wide margin — which makes the plugin boundary the cheapest place to attach anything new. |
| [oppia/oppia](https://github.com/oppia/oppia) | **Apache-2.0** | 7.0k | "A free, online learning platform to make quality education accessible for all." Python + Angular on App Engine. **The largest permissively licensed learning platform found** — the one core on this shelf a studio can fork without copyleft consequences. |
| [instructure/canvas-lms](https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms) | AGPL-3.0 | 6.9k | "The open LMS by Instructure, Inc." Dominant in North American higher ed. Caveat worth repeating to any client: the open-source codebase is **not** equivalent to Instructure's full commercial feature set. |
| [frappe/lms](https://github.com/frappe/lms) | AGPL-3.0 | 3.4k | "Easy to Use, 100% Open Source Learning Management System." Lighter and newer than Moodle, and it sits on the Frappe/ERPNext stack — which makes it the natural LMS when the client already runs Frappe for administration. |
| [sakaiproject/sakai](https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai) | **ECL-2.0** | 1.2k | Higher-ed teaching, research and collaboration platform. Educational Community License 2.0 is an Apache-2.0 derivative with a patent-grant tweak for academic consortia — **permissive in practice**. Page lists 25.2 and 23.5 as community-supported. |
| [learningequality/kolibri](https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri) | **MIT** | 1.2k | "The offline app for universal education." Python + JS, `develop` branch, ~39.8k commits. **The only MIT-licensed full learning platform on this shelf**, and the only one designed for intermittent or absent connectivity — which is the deciding constraint for LMIC and rural deployments in LATAM, Africa and South/Southeast Asia. |
| [overhangio/tutor](https://github.com/overhangio/tutor) | AGPL-3.0 | 1.1k | "The Docker-based Open edX distribution designed for peace of mind." In practice nobody should deploy Open edX by hand; this is the supported path, and the plugin system is where customisation belongs. |
| [chamilo/chamilo-lms](https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms) | GPL-3.0 | 1.0k | LMS focused on ease of use and accessibility; install docs reference **v2.0.3**. Strong footprint in Spanish- and French-speaking deployments with small or no technical staff — relevant for LATAM public-sector work. |

## Administration, records and integrity

| Repo | Licence | Stars | Why it is foundational |
|---|---|---|---|
| [openeducat/openeducat_erp](https://github.com/openeducat/openeducat_erp) | LGPL-3.0 | 900 | "Comprehensive Open Source ERP for Educational Institutes", built as Odoo modules; branch `19.0`. Admissions, timetabling, attendance, fees, library, hostel. The ERP counterpart to the LMS cores above. |
| [portabilis/i-educar](https://github.com/portabilis/i-educar) | GPL-2.0 | 722 | **LATAM anchor.** School-management software described on its own page as "the largest free education software in Brazil" — originally built by the municipal government of **Itajaí, Santa Catarina**, released on the Brazilian federal Public Software Portal in 2008, now stewarded by Portábilis. Any Brazilian public-sector education engagement meets this system. |
| [francoisjacquet/rosariosis](https://github.com/francoisjacquet/rosariosis) | GPL-2.0 | 648 | "RosarioSIS Student Information System for school management." PHP/PostgreSQL, modular, widely deployed in small and mid-size schools; strong Spanish/French/Portuguese localisation. Origin is not stated on the repo page. |
| [ILIAS-eLearning/ILIAS](https://github.com/ILIAS-eLearning/ILIAS) | GPL-3.0 | 505 | **EMEA anchor.** German non-profit-governed LMS, branch `release_11`. The usual choice for compliance-heavy European public-sector and government training, where governance provenance matters as much as features. |
| [OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT](https://github.com/OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT) | **Apache-2.0** | 449 | **EMEA, permissive.** Swiss web-based LMS covering teaching, learning, assessment and communication. Apache-2.0 plus a European governance story is a rare combination on this shelf — the best base for an EMEA engagement that needs to ship proprietary extensions. |
| [dodona-edu/dolos](https://github.com/dodona-edu/dolos) | **MIT** | 355 | "Source code plagiarism detection" — finds similar or modified solutions to programming exercises. From Ghent University (**EMEA**). No LLM in it, and that is the point: assessment-integrity findings have to be explainable to an appeals board. |
| [h5p/h5p-php-library](https://github.com/h5p/h5p-php-library) | GPL-3.0 | 152 | Framework-independent PHP library for H5P interactive content; platforms integrate through its interfaces. H5P is the de facto interoperable format for interactive exercises across Moodle, Canvas, Open edX and Drupal — the cheapest way to make generated content portable. |
| [openfun/ralph](https://github.com/openfun/ralph) | **MIT** | 51 | "The ultimate Learning Record Store (and more!) for your learning analytics." Python/FastAPI/Pydantic, from France Université Numérique (**EMEA**). Fifty-one stars and genuinely load-bearing: it is the **xAPI/LRS seam** where agent-generated learning events get stored in a standard shape instead of a vendor's private table. |

## Licence map, for the architecture decision

| Band | Repos |
|---|---|
| **Permissive — fork freely** | Oppia (Apache-2.0), OpenOLAT (Apache-2.0), Sakai (ECL-2.0), Kolibri (MIT), Dolos (MIT), Ralph (MIT) |
| **Weak copyleft — link across a boundary** | BigBlueButton (LGPL-3.0), OpenEduCat (LGPL-3.0) |
| **Strong copyleft — integrate, do not fork** | Moodle, Chamilo, ILIAS, H5P (GPL-3.0); i-educar, RosarioSIS (GPL-2.0) |
| **Network copyleft — integrate, do not fork, and read §13** | Open edX, Canvas, Frappe LMS, Tutor (AGPL-3.0) |

AGPL-3.0 §13 reaches users interacting over a network, which is precisely the
hosted-SaaS shape most engagements want. **The integration seams — LTI 1.3, xAPI
via Ralph, H5P content, Canvas/Moodle REST, MCP servers — are where permissive
code belongs.**

## Searched and not found

- **No mainstream Apache/MIT-licensed LMS** beyond Oppia and OpenOLAT. Searched
  explicitly; the sector is copyleft and that is the finding.
- **No permissively licensed SIS.** Every student-information system found is
  GPL-2.0 or GPL-3.0; the AI-native advising option
  ([canyongbs/advisingapp](https://github.com/canyongbs/advisingapp)) is
  Elastic-2.0 and therefore unusable as a hosted base.
- **No APAC-origin platform core surfaced on the platform legs this pass.** APAC's
  open-source strength in education showed up entirely on the *agent* legs
  (DeepTutor, OpenMAIC) — see [`../agents/top.md`](../agents/top.md). Moodle's
  Perth origin is historical and its governance is now global.
