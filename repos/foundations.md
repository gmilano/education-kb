# Education — foundational repos

**Pass 90, 2026-10-09.** Same ladder as `agents/top.md`: existence by `git ls-remote --symref`, **licence read
from the payload** pinned to the resolved SHA. Two-sided control passed. `—` in ★ means not read this pass.

A *foundation* here is a repo a studio can standardise on **across clients**, independent of which LMS any one
client runs. The useful property of this tier is that it sits on spec boundaries (SCORM, xAPI, cmi5, QTI,
Open Badges, LTI), and spec-boundary code is permissive far more often than product code.

## Tier 1 — content and learner-data interoperability

This is the tier to own. Every education engagement eventually has to move content *into* a platform the client
already runs and get learner data *out* of it.

| repo | grant (payload · bytes · ref · SHA) | ★ | region | role in a build |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`jcputney/scorm-again`](https://github.com/jcputney/scorm-again) | **MIT** · 1 072 B · `master` · `882f3b8` | 354 | 🔵 unplaced | The runtime shim. SCORM 1.2 / 2004 API surface for any content in any LMS. |
| [`adlnet/xAPI-SCORM-Profile`](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-SCORM-Profile) | **Apache-2.0** · 11 324 B · `master` · `ea17c40` | 42 | **North America** (US DoD / ADL) | The authoritative SCORM → xAPI statement mapping. The audit-trail spec. |
| [`adlnet/ADL_LRS`](https://github.com/adlnet/ADL_LRS) | **Apache-2.0** · 11 357 B · `master` · `efa045e` | — | **North America** (US DoD / ADL) | Reference Learning Record Store — the canonical implementation to test against. |
| [`yetanalytics/lrsql`](https://github.com/yetanalytics/lrsql) | **Apache-2.0** · 11 357 B · `main` · `cb794e4` | — | **North America** (Yet Analytics, US) | **A production SQL LRS.** Apache-2.0 and backed by a real database — this is the one to deploy, where `ADL_LRS` is the one to conform to. |
| [`tunapanda/h5p-standalone`](https://github.com/tunapanda/h5p-standalone) | **MIT** · 1 077 B · `master` · `b5ac7dd` | — | 🟡 **EMEA** (Tunapanda, Kenya lineage) | 🟢 **The MIT escape hatch from H5P's GPL core.** Plays H5P content with no LMS and no GPL server-side library. See the flag below. |
| [`celtic-project/LTI-PHP`](https://github.com/celtic-project/LTI-PHP) | 🟡 **LGPL-3.0** · 7 651 B · `master` · `1f47c93` | — | **EMEA** (UK) | LTI 1.3 tool provider. 🟡 LGPL — link, do not fork into a closed binary. |
| [`1EdTech/openbadges-validator-core`](https://github.com/1EdTech/openbadges-validator-core) | **Apache-2.0** · 13 185 B · `develop` · `0a66b52` | — | **North America** (1EdTech) | Open Badges validation. The credentialing tier's conformance gate. |

## Tier 2 — assessment and automated feedback

| repo | grant (payload · bytes · ref · SHA) | ★ | region | role in a build |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`numbas/Numbas`](https://github.com/numbas/Numbas) | **Apache-2.0** · 11 357 B · `master` · `39b03e5` | 215 | **EMEA** (Newcastle University, UK) | Browser-native e-assessment with real mathematics; SCORM-packageable. The strongest permissive assessment engine on this shelf. |
| [`Submitty/Submitty`](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty) | **BSD** · 1 542 B · `main` · `80d7d66` | — | **North America** (RPI, US) | Full course-management + autograding platform, **BSD**. Permissive and production — rare in this tier. |
| [`ucbds-infra/otter-grader`](https://github.com/ucbds-infra/otter-grader) | **BSD** · 1 560 B · `master` · `190c1a4` | — | **North America** (UC Berkeley, US) | Notebook autograding; the standard in data-science teaching. |
| [`jupyter/nbgrader`](https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader) | **BSD** · 1 512 B · `main` · `f9915da` | — | **North America** (Project Jupyter) | Assignment release/collect/grade for notebooks. |
| [`webtech-network/autograder`](https://github.com/webtech-network/autograder) | **Apache-2.0** · 11 357 B · `main` · `04bee3e` | — | 🔵 unplaced | Rubric-driven autograding with report generation; release 0.4.0 (May 2026). |

## Tier 3 — delivery, runtime and agent substrate

| repo | grant (payload · bytes · ref · SHA) | ★ | region | role in a build |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`learningequality/kolibri`](https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri) | **MIT** · 1 097 B · `develop` · `d4fea9c` | — | **North America** (Learning Equality, US) | **Offline-first learning delivery.** MIT. The correct substrate wherever connectivity is the binding constraint — which, per UNESCO, is most of APAC's and LATAM's deployment reality, not an edge case. |
| [`oppia/oppia`](https://github.com/oppia/oppia) | **Apache-2.0** · 11 358 B · `develop` · `ad22e91` | — | **North America** (Oppia Foundation) | Structured, explanation-driven interactive lessons; a real pedagogy model in code. |
| [`oppia/oppia-android`](https://github.com/oppia/oppia-android) | **Apache-2.0** · 11 357 B · `develop` · `25e3860` | — | **North America** | The offline Android client for the above. |
| [`jupyterhub/jupyterhub`](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub) | **BSD** · 1 475 B · `main` · `f02ec3c` | — | 🔵 unplaced | Multi-tenant notebook serving — the per-learner compute boundary. |
| [`langchain-ai/langgraph`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) | **MIT** · 1 072 B · `main` · `12aeb0f` | — | **North America** | Stateful agent orchestration. The graph, not the agent. |
| [`huggingface/smolagents`](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) | **Apache-2.0** · 11 357 B · `main` · `96f33fa` | — | **EMEA** (Hugging Face, FR lineage) | Minimal agent loop; the low-ceremony option when LangGraph is too much machinery. |

## Licence flags in this tier — the traps

| repo | grant | why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| [`h5p/h5p-php-library`](https://github.com/h5p/h5p-php-library) | 🔴 **GPL-3.0** · 35 146 B · `master` · `cb64a1f` | 🔴 **H5P's core is GPL.** The interactive-content ecosystem everyone reaches for is copyleft at the library level. Use `tunapanda/h5p-standalone` (MIT) for playback instead of linking this. |
| [`lumieducation/H5P-Nodejs-library`](https://github.com/lumieducation/H5P-Nodejs-library) | 🔴 **GPL-3.0** · 35 146 B · `master` · `ac2d6aa` | 🔴 The Node port is GPL too. There is no permissive H5P *authoring* server. |
| [`LearningLocker/learninglocker`](https://github.com/LearningLocker/learninglocker) | 🔴 **GPL-3.0** · 35 141 B · `master` · `5fec948` | 🔴 The best-known LRS is GPL. `yetanalytics/lrsql` (Apache-2.0) is the permissive substitute, and it is the better-maintained one. |
| [`PrairieLearn/PrairieLearn`](https://github.com/PrairieLearn/PrairieLearn) | 🔴 **AGPL-3.0** · 36 983 B · `master` · `d1e44b4` | 🔴 Excellent adaptive-assessment engine (UIUC), AGPL — network copyleft, so hosting it for a client triggers reciprocity. |
| [`INGInious/INGInious`](https://github.com/INGInious/INGInious) | 🔴 **AGPL-3.0** · 34 764 B · `main` · `8f90cc8` | 🔴 UCLouvain autograder, AGPL. |
| [`GatorEducator/gatorgrader`](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) | 🔴 **GPL-3.0** · 35 191 B · `master` · `3be3278` | 🔴 |
| [`ucfopen/UDOIT`](https://github.com/ucfopen/UDOIT) | 🔴 **GPL-3.0** · 35 147 B · `main` · `61b5d8f` | 🔴 The only LMS accessibility checker found. GPL, and not AI-driven. The permissive AI-accessibility gap stands. |
| [`oat-sa/tao-core`](https://github.com/oat-sa/tao-core) | 🟡 **LGPL-3.0** · 18 025 B · `develop` · `d9d462a` | 🟡 TAO (Open Assessment Technologies, Luxembourg) — the serious QTI platform. LGPL: linkable. |
| [`1EdTech/openbadges-specification`](https://github.com/1EdTech/openbadges-specification) | 🔴 **No licence payload** (17 filenames) | 🔴 The *specification* repo carries no grant, while the *validator* repo is Apache-2.0. Cite the validator. |
| [`eecs-autograder/autograder.io`](https://github.com/eecs-autograder/autograder.io) | 🔴 **No licence payload** (17 filenames) | 🔵 Consistent with its own README — it is a docs/issue tracker, not the code. Not a defect, but not a dependency either. |

## Slugs that do not exist

🔴 Three slugs that circulate in roundups and in this KB's own earlier passes resolved **ABSENT** this pass.
Recorded so they are not re-tried:

- `apereo/opencast` → 🟢 the real slug is [`opencast/opencast`](https://github.com/opencast/opencast)
- `tutor-dev/tutor` → 🟢 the real slug is [`overhangio/tutor`](https://github.com/overhangio/tutor)
- `h5p/h5p-standalone` → 🟢 the real slug is [`tunapanda/h5p-standalone`](https://github.com/tunapanda/h5p-standalone)

## Count, stated plainly

**19 foundational rows above the flag line; 16 of them permissive (MIT / Apache-2.0 / BSD), 1 LGPL.**
The interoperability and assessment tiers really are the permissive heart of this industry — that earlier
finding survives this pass, and is now measured on a larger sample.

*Prior pass content is preserved in git history at commit `457eaba` and earlier.*
